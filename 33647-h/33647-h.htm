<p>The text of <i>Alida</i> is given twice. First it is presented

<p>Footnotes are in the original.</p>

<p>French and Italian quotations are shown as printed, retaining obvious

<p>The use of “filial” for “parental” and the random variation between
“meantime” and “mean time” are also unchanged. In Chapter XXVII,
“team-boat” is not an error. Typographical errors are shown in the text

<p>Having read the new work entitled “<span class =
"smallcaps">Alida</span>,” or Miscellaneous Sketches of Occurrences
during the late American War, which abounds with elegance of language,
sublime poetry, and useful lessons&mdash;as an American, I&nbsp;have a
pride in saying, that our press has seldom been honoured with a work as
improving and interesting to the reader, and as well written as any to
be found either among the older or modern authors.</p>

<p class = "right">
<span class = "smallcaps">J. H. Hardenbrook.</span></p>

<p class = "section">
It may be here proper to rectify a slight mistake in two of the
complimentary pieces written on the contents of Alida, in which the work
was innocently stated to have been expressly <i>written</i> for the aid
of benevolent purposes; instead of which it should have read [expressly
<i>printed</i>] for the aid of benevolent purposes. The truth is, some
part was written as a journal of incidents, and to amuse leisure hours
somewhat usefully; other parts to commemorate some particular facts for
the gratification of the author and near relatives, not expecting any
other eye to meet a single line of it. But on being looked over by an
affectionate pious friend, the author was solicited to allow it to be
printed. It was at length acceded to, on the ground that the proceeds,
however little over the expenses attending it, should be appropriated to
charitable purposes.</p>

<p>It is but just to embrace this opportunity to express the reciprocal
kind feelings of the author, not only for the friendly and encouraging
encomiums above alluded to, with other kind approvals which have
appeared in print,&mdash;but for the <i>call</i> of a third edition so
soon, being within the <i>first</i> year of its appearance. The
favourable reception which the former editions of this work has met with
from the public, in these trying times (when so many valuable works are
permitted to lay useless on the shelves of the book-sellers,) encourages
the editor to attempt the publication of another edition. The author has
embraced the opportunity carefully to revise and correct the
typographical mistakes in the former editions, and to enlarge the work
with additional prose and poetry, which it is humbly hoped will be found
both pleasing and useful.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> ancestry of Alida was of ancient
date in English heraldry, some of whom emigrated to America a short time
before the revolution, and settled in the southern provinces, while her
father fixed his abode in the state of New-York.</p>

<p>In the calm retirement of the country, at a considerable distance
from the bustle of the town, was situated his beautiful residence, which
had every advantage in point of prospect that luxuriant nature could
give when it is most lavish of its bounties.</p>

<p>The mind of its owner took particular delight in rural pleasures and
amusements; in dissipating a part of his time in the innocent scenes of
rustic life, and in attending to the cultivation of his estate, which
was large and extensive.</p>

<p>Here he would contemplate, in all their variety,

the natural beauties of creation, when arrayed in its richest attire; in
the inimitable splendour of the surrounding scenery; or amuse himself in
attendance to diversified employments, some of which, as pastimes,
served the two-fold purposes of recreation and amusement.</p>

<p>Thus his years glided on in the most harmonious tranquil&shy;lity;
where his cares were dissipated alternately in the bosom of his family,
and the “tumults of life, real or imaginary, fleeted away in a mutual
confidence and unreserved friendship.”</p>

<p>Here he would accustom himself to rise at early dawn, and dwell with
particular pleasure on the morning scenery. The dappled, rosy-fingered,
blushing morn, arrested his attention; those mild tints that
particularly express the break of day, just awakening from repose; when
the curtain of the night seems insensibly withdrawn, and the varied
landscape exhibits itself by degrees, while the colours of the
atmosphere yet seem doubtful, and the scene imperfect to the view; when
the darkness is not entirely fled, nor the light of the new day is fully
seen; when coolness sits upon the hills, and the dews hang trembling
upon every leaf; when the groves begin to resound with the murmurs of
warbling melody, and the valleys echo with reverberated sounds.</p>

<a class = "pagenum" name = "page15" id = "page15"

<p>How pleasing at such a time to adore in his works the wonders of the
Creator. That period when the sun begins to diffuse his early rays, to
tip the mountains with light, and the breezes in the air mildly
prognosticate the soft blushes of the morning:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“For far beyond the pageantry of power,</p>
<p>He lov’d the realms of Nature to explore;</p>
<p>With lingering gaze Edenian spring survey’d&mdash;</p>
<p>Morn’s fairy splendours&mdash;Night’s gay curtain’d shade&mdash;</p>
<p>The heaven-embosom’d sun&mdash;the rainbow’s dye,</p>
<p>Where lucid forms appear to Fancy’s eye;</p>
<p>The vernal flower, mild Autumn’s purpling glow,</p>
<p>The Summer’s thunder, and the winter’s snow.”</p>
</div>

<p>Or, when the evening approached, he would observe the twilight hour,
which for a time hangs balanced between darkness and the pale rays of
the western sky, communicating a solemn pleasure to every thing around.
When evening began to throw her dusky mantle over the face of nature,
and the warm glow of the summer sun had departed; when the stars were
glistening in the heavens, and the moon had already risen, shedding its
pale lustre over the opposite islands “that appeared to float dimly
among the waves, the twinkling fire-fly arose from the surrounding
verdure, and illumined the meadow below with a thousand transient gems.”
The rustling breezes played among the trees of the wood, while the air
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page16" id = "page16"
href = "#par_page16">16</a>
was filled with the fragrance of various flowers, and the sound of
melodious music was wafted from the neighbouring village, rendered
apparently more soft and sweet by the distance.</p>

<p>The buildings on the estate consisted of a large mansion-house,
farm-house, and an ancient stone cottage that stood on the margin of the
water, shaded by willow trees, and surrounded by romantic scenery.</p>

<p>The charming appearance which nature threw around the place on which
the mansion-house was situated, was scarcely less interesting in winter
than in the more gay and verdant months of the summer season. The
falling of the snow and hail, and the sparkling icicles hanging upon the
woods and shrubbery, sometimes almost conveyed the idea of enchantment
to the imagination of the spectator.</p>

<p>The view on all sides was magnificent. The bay, gently winding,
glided into the river beyond, where ships, steamboats, and craft of
every description, floated upon the waters, and gave interest to the
appearance of several beautiful villages that were seen at a little
distance in the landscape.</p>

<p>This villa was separated about a mile from the flourishing village of
&mdash;&mdash;, where the many white buildings, some of which might be
called magnificent, had a remarkably pleasing and picturesque
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page17" id = "page17"
href = "#par_page17">17</a>
appearance, forming a lively contrast with the evergreen trees with
which they were interspersed.</p>

<p>The house of Alida’s father was the seat of hospitality;&mdash;scenes
of festivity would sometimes have place within its walls;&mdash;“music
and mirth would occasionally echo through its apartments.” He was kind,
generous, and benevolent; while his independence, assisted by a
charitable disposition, enabled him to contribute largely to the
happiness of others. His manners were highly pleasing, his conversation
was interesting, humorous, and instructive; and, although at this time
he was rather advanced in years, yet the glow of health still shone upon
his cheek and sparkled in his eye; and his fine expressive countenance
still gave lustre to a peculiar dignity and energy in his personal
appearance.</p>

<p>It was now many years since he had made this delightful spot his
residence. He had married early in life a lady of engaging manners, and
captivating beauty, who was amiable, sensible, and pious, and whose mind
was a pattern of every female excellence, combined with a taste and
judgment that had been properly directed by a suitable education; who
had been taught to esteem no farther all the acquirements and qualities
of which the human mind is capable than as they might be conducive to
enable us to excel in the duties of the Christian religion,
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page18" id = "page18"
href = "#par_page18">18</a>
and cause us more fully to experience “the blessings of the truth.”</p>

<p>These parents had reared up all their family except Alida, their
youngest child, who at this time was placed at a boarding-school, at the
village of &mdash;&mdash;, where she was taught, in addition to the
different studies belonging to a Christian education, the French and
Italian languages.</p>

<p>Their elder daughters had married, and were settled at some distance
from them, and their two sons were engaged in mercantile business in
New-York. It was their principal endeavour, as their thoughts often
revolved in anxious solicitude for the welfare and future happiness of
their children, to unite their efforts to persuade them, and inculcate
in their minds all that was praiseworthy, by the immediate influence of
their own example, considering that the precepts which they taught them,
however wise and good, would avail but little unassisted by the aid of
example.</p>

<p class = "chapterhead">
“Le mauvais usage que nous faisons de la vie, la dérègle, et la rend
malheureuse.”</p>

<p>It was their first care to exercise the minds of their children, in
all the important moral and religious duties; to be careful in due time
to regulate their natural propensities; to render their dispositions
mild and tractable; to inspire them with the
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page19" id = "page19"
href = "#par_page19">19</a>
love, respect, and implicit obedience due to parents, blended with a
genuine affection for relations and friends.</p>

<p>“To endeavour to form their first ideas on principles of rectitude,
being conscious of the infinite importance of first impressions, and
beginning early to adhere to a proper system of education, that was
principally the result of their own reflections and particular
observations.”</p>

<p>Their children were assembled annually to celebrate the birthday of
their father, together with other social friends and acquaintances,
consisting chiefly of those whose beneficent feelings were in accordance
with their own, in testifying their gratitude to their Creator for daily
benefits, blended with a thankful cheerfulness, which is the offspring
of moral excellence.</p>

<p class = "chapterhead">
The scenes that once so brilliant shone are past, and can return no more
to cheer the pensive heart; and memory recalls them with a tear; some
lowering cloud succeeds, and all the gay delusive landscape fades.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">While</span> Alida remained at the village
school, surrounded by the festive scenes of childhood, and pursuing her
studies with assiduous emulation, with the hope of meriting, in future
time, the praises of her fond parents, an unforeseen misfortune awaited
her that no human foresight could have power to arrest.</p>

<p>The health of her mother had been long declining, and her illness at
this time increased so far as to render medical assistance useless, and
baffled the skill of the ablest physicians. A&nbsp;trial so new, so
afflicting, and so grievous to her youthful mind, to lose one of her
honoured parents, and to be unexpectedly summoned to her parental home
to receive the last benediction of a beloved mother, and at this early
period of her life to be deprived of her kind care and protection, was
unfortunate in the extreme.</p>

<p>Every anxious solicitude and responsibility now rested alone upon a
widowed father, who mourned deeply their common bereavement, while he
felt conscious that all his fatherly care and caresses could never
supply to Alida all the necessary requisitions
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page22" id = "page22"
href = "#par_page22">22</a>
that she had unhappily lost in so dear and interested a friend. When he
observed her spirits languish, and the tear frequently starting in her
eye, and her former sprightly countenance shaded with the deep tinges of
melancholy, he saw that the cheerfulness and gaiety of her natural
disposition had received a powerful check, which promised to be
lasting.</p>

<p>From this unhappy period she remained at home a long time with her
father. In kindred grief there was derived a congenial sympathy, and her
society contributed in some degree to allay his sorrow, as the deep
concern he felt in her welfare caused him sometimes to restrain the flow
of it in her presence. Self-exertion roused him in a measure from his
lethargy, and by thus assuming serenity, to become in reality something
more composed. Nevertheless, he would often witness the excess of
anguish which had taken place in the bosom of his child, and behold her
interesting face bathed in tears, and her youthful brow clouded with a
sadness that nothing seemingly could dissipate.</p>

<p>His situation now became more sequestered than ever; he roamed in
solitude, or pleased himself in ranging through silent glens in
loneliness. His thoughts were absorbed in the gloomy experience of the
misery of a painful separation from a dear and beloved object; he wept
for her whose mild
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page23" id = "page23"
href = "#par_page23">23</a>
and winning graces had power to soften and illuminate the darkest shades
of life, or alleviate the distressful scenes of adversity.</p>

<p>His mind was wholly absorbed in those gloomy reflections that
scarcely admitted a ray of consolation, when the weekly newspaper
arrived from the neighbouring village; he took it up, hoping to find
something to amuse his thoughts; he opened it to read the news of the
day; he ran his eye hastily over it, and was about to lay it aside,
“when the death list arrested his attention by a display of broad black
lines,” and he, who had not yet become reconciled to his present
misfortune, was now about to experience another equally severe.</p>

<p>What could equal his bitterness, his surprise and grief, when he read
the disastrous news that his youngest son (who had lately gone on a
foreign expedition) had died of a fever in a distant land a few weeks
previous!</p>

<p>The paper fell from his palsied hand,&mdash;a sudden faintness came
over him,&mdash;he fell back almost senseless in his
chair,&mdash;exhausted by excess of grief, he remained a long time in a
stupifying anguish.</p>

<p>The tidings were so unlooked-for of the premature death of his
unfortunate son, who about this time was expected to arrive in New-York.
For
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page24" id = "page24"
href = "#par_page24">24</a>
him an only brother was inconsolable; and Alida, who had long been
accustomed to his kindness and caresses, was overcome with a dejection
that time alone could alleviate.</p>

<p>Her father observed her affliction in <ins class = "correction" title
= "text unchanged">commisseration</ins> with his own,&mdash;he was
dejected and lonely, and the world appeared like a wilderness; nothing
could lessen his present evil, or soothe his afflicted mind.</p>

<p>The former peaceful serenity of his life was materially clouded; and
in his turn calamitous wo had overtaken him&mdash;the inalienable
portion of humanity,&mdash;and the varied and shifting scenery in the
great drama of time had brought with it disaster. His spirit was sunk in
despondency, and his sensations became utterly absorbed in melancholy;
and all the pious and philosophical reflections that he exerted himself
to bring to his remembrance, could scarcely afford even a transitory
consolation in this afflicting dispensation.</p>

</div>


<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> period at length arrived, when
it became necessary that Alida should receive further instruction in the
various branches of female literature. With this view, her father
thought proper to change the place of her studies from the village
school to the New-York Seminary.</p>

<p>It was his idea that nothing afforded so pleasing a prospect as the
graces of beauty, aided by wisdom and useful knowledge, and that care
should be taken that the mind should first be initiated in the solid
acquirements, before the embellishments of education should be allowed
to take up the attention or engross the thoughts; and that the first
purposes of the teacher should be directed to endeavour to cause the
mental powers of the scholar to be excited, in the first place, to
attain to whatever is most useful and necessary, and that suitable
application and industry was the only means whereby
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page28" id = "page28"
href = "#par_page28">28</a>
we may gain celebrity in any art or science, or therein arrive at any
degree of perfection.</p>

<p>“His heart glowed with paternal fondness and interesting solicitude,
when he beheld the countenance of his child sparkling with intelligence,
or traced the progress of reason in her awakened curiosity when any new
object attracted her attention or exercised her imagination.” Delightful
indeed were the sensations of a parent in the contemplation of so fair a
prospect, which in some degree recalled again to his bosom some
transient gleams of happiness.</p>

<p>The season was now far advanced in autumn, and the trees were nearly
stripped of their foliage; the radiant sun had in part withdrawn his
enlivening rays to give place to the approaching coldness of winter,
when Alida left her home, amid the innumerable regrets of her juvenile
companions, to accom&shy;pany her father to the city to finish her
education.</p>

<p>They journeyed in a stage-coach from the village of &mdash;&mdash;,
which, in the course of a few hours, conveyed them amid the tumultuous
din of the busy metropolis. The female seminary to which Alida repaired
was pleasantly situated in the western part of the town, where the
refreshing and salubrious
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page29" id = "page29"
href = "#par_page29">29</a>
breezes of the Hudson rendered it a healthy and desirable situation at
all seasons of the year.</p>

<p>Although her father had only performed his duty in placing his child
once more at school, yet it was at a greater distance from the paternal
roof than formerly, and when he returned again to his residence, he felt
his situation more lonely than ever, and he could scarcely reconcile
himself to the loss of her society.</p>

<p>All was novel-like in the city to Alida, where she at once saw so
many different objects to excite alternately her surprise, curiosity,
and risibility, and where she experienced so many different sensations,
arising from the sudden transition in being removed from scenes of
uninterrupted tranquil&shy;lity to those of gaiety and pleasure, of
crowded streets and riotous entertainments, of obsequious beaux and
dashing petits maîtres, and where all appeared to her one continued
scene of business and confusion, scarcely <ins class = "correction"
title = "text unchanged: word may be contamination from end of previous paragraph">reconcileable</ins>.</p>

<p>In the meantime her mind became engrossed by various new occupations.
Among her favourite studies was the French language, which, at this
period, was considered as one of the necessary appendages to female
education, when scarcely any new work could be read without a regret to
those who did not understand it. Music, dancing, and
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page30" id = "page30"
href = "#par_page30">30</a>
drawing occupied her time alternately, and while these different
amusements afforded a pleasing variety, they animated her mind anew with
the powers of exertion that had been excited by early
impressions&mdash;that whatever she attempted to learn, to be assiduous
to learn it well, and that a mere superficial knowledge, in any science
or accom&shy;plishment, was by no means desirable.</p>

<p>All her studies and amusements had their regular arrangements, and
due application gave her many advantages over those of her own age,
while it expanded her mind in a greater degree, and facilitated her
progress in learning, and gave more ready improvement to her
understanding and native capacities.</p>

<p>Her only surviving brother, whose name was Albert, had been a
merchant in the city a number of years, and he still continued to live
amid its perplexities, (although numbers had been unfortunate around
him,) with as good success as could be expected at this time, on account
of the restrictions on American commerce. One probable reason may be
assigned why he had been more successful in his business than many
others: he was guided in the management of his affairs by vigilance and
industrious perseverance, and he was not only endued with the best
abilities to fulfil the duties
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page31" id = "page31"
href = "#par_page31">31</a>
incumbent on his station in life, but was not remiss in the exercise of
them. His manners, generally, were reserved, though he could be humorous
and gay whenever occasion required; and when in convivial society, he
could make one among the number of those who amused themselves in
sallies of wit and pleasantry. He had acquired much useful and general
information in his commerce with the world at large, which he employed
at this time in various conversations on politics, as he could not be
able to render himself serviceable to his country in any other way,
being exempt from his childhood from performing military duty. His
personal advantages were only surpassed by the superior qualifications
of his mind, that had long been under religious influence and
impressions. In his public and private life he fully answered the
expectations of his numerous acquaintance and friends, as well as the
most sanguine wishes of an anxious and affectionate father, who yet
seemed disposed to indulge in melancholy reflections, while his friends
kindly endeavoured, by many pious and philosophical discourses, to
awaken him to a consideration of his former piety, and humble trust in
an all-wise Providence, reminding him that our greatest consolation
consists in resigned and devotional feelings of gratitude to our Maker,
even in the severest
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page32" id = "page32"
href = "#par_page32">32</a>
afflictions; who, although he may have thought fit to deprive us of
some, for the many remaining blessings we may still be in possession of;
and that a firm reliance on Providence, however our affections may be at
variance with its dispensations, is the only consolatory source that we
can have recourse to in the gloomy hours of distress; and that such
dependance, though often crossed by troubles and difficulties, may at
length be crowned with success in our most arduous undertakings, and we
may again meet with unlooked-for and unexpected happiness.</p>

<p>The clear, calm sunshine of a mind illumined by piety, and a firm
reliance upon Supreme wisdom, crowns all other divine blessings. It
irradiates the progress of life, and dispels the evils attendant on our
nature; it renders the mind calm and pacific, and promotes that
cheerfulness and resignation which has its foundation in a life of
rectitude and charity; and in the full exercise of Christian principles
we may find still increasing happiness.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">Many</span> disagreeable circumstances now
combined to disturb the happy tranquil&shy;lity of the American
government. “A&nbsp;war had for some time existed between France and
England. America had endeavoured to maintain a neutrality, and
peacefully to continue a commerce with both nations. Jealousies,
however, arose between the contending powers with respect to the conduct
of America, and events occurred calculated to injure her commerce and
disturb her peace.</p>

<p>“Decrees were first issued by the French government preventing the
American flag from trading with the enemy; these were followed by the
British orders in council, no less extensive than the former in design,
and equally repugnant to the laws of nations. In addition to these
circumstances, a&nbsp;cause of irritation existed sometime between the
United States and Great Britain. This was the right of search claimed by
Great Britain as one of her prerogatives. To take her native subjects,
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page34" id = "page34"
href = "#par_page34">34</a>
wherever found, for her navy, and to search American vessels for that
purpose. Notwith&shy;standing the remonstrances of the American
government, the officers of the British navy were not unfrequently seen
seizing native British subjects who had voluntarily enlisted on board
our vessels, and had also impressed into the British service some
thousands of American seamen.</p>

<p>“In consequence of the British and French decrees, a&nbsp;general
capture of all American property on the seas seemed almost inevitable.
Congress, therefore, on the recommendation of the president, laid an
embargo on all vessels within the jurisdiction of the United States.</p>

<p>“In a moment, the commerce of the American republic, from being, in
point of extent, the second in the world, was reduced to a coasting
trade between the individual states. The opposition to the act in
several of the states was so great that they unanimously declared
against it, and individuals throughout the whole seized every
opportunity of infringement; therefore Congress thought proper to repeal
the embargo law, and substituted a non-intercourse with France and
England.”</p>

<p>It was now generally expected that the session in Congress, with the
decision of the president, would eventually terminate in actual
hostilities.
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page35" id = "page35"
href = "#par_page35">35</a>
The difficulties the chief executive had to encounter were many and
perplexing, being fully convinced, under existing circumstances, that
the Americans must engage in combat after all. He therefore knew it to
be necessary to rouse the feelings of the American people, to realize,
more clearly than they did, the true situation of their country, that
they might be prepared for the approaching crisis that he believed
unavoidable.</p>

<p>This period was full of anxiety and danger. A&nbsp;war was deprecated
by all the leading patriots of the day; they were fully persuaded that
it must take place; they therefore unitedly determined to prepare for
the storm in the best manner they were able. All material business was
in a manner suspended in New-York; the face of things wore a dismal
aspect, and the greater part of the community were in dismay.
A&nbsp;heavy gloom hung over the inhabitants generally, while all their
affairs appeared in a declining state, discouraging to the industry and
best prospects of the people.</p>

<p>Alida’s father was no friend to political controversy, yet he passed
much of his time in conversing with his friends on the present affairs
of America. He knew that party spirit and animosity existed more or less
at this time, and that he must consequently often meet with those of
opposite
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page36" id = "page36"

opinions; yet his honest and patriotic zeal for the good of his country
still remained the same. He was attached to liberty from principle; he
had talents to discriminate and see into the justice of the measures of
government; his retirement gave him full opportunity to reflect on them
seriously, and solve them in his own mind, and see their absolute
necessity, in order to maintain the honour, freedom, and independence of
the American nation. Would the same wisdom in the government continue
that had so nobly preserved us since our independence? But he had no
reason at present to suppose otherwise, and that he who now guided the
helm of affairs, was one of steady and uncorrupt principles, of stable
character, altogether uninfluenced by any sinister views, and was
willing to sacrifice his individual repose for the noble purpose, and
with the hope of settling it again on the nation, with a firmer basis,
at some future period, when the expected contest should be decided.</p>

<p>What feelings of commotion and deep anxiety must agitate the bosom of
the magnanimous hero who is labouring truly for the interest of his
country, and is actuated alternately by the claims of justice and
humanity, and on whom a whole community must depend for council in cases
of severe emergency, when his chief satisfaction consists in
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page37" id = "page37"
href = "#par_page37">37</a>
promoting the interest and welfare of that community. When the hour of
exigency arrives, his mind, endued with the light of piety, feels its
own littleness, his weighty thoughts are big with the impending danger
that no human arm may be able to arrest. Impressed with religious awe,
and feeling conscious of his dependence for aid on the all-wise Disposer
of events, he bends in humble supplication to implore the favour of that
great and beneficent Being whose power alone can save, and in whose
mighty arm alone is victory.</p>

<p>The father of Alida received regular intelligence by the daily papers
respecting the political excitement in New-York; besides, he made
frequent visits to the city to see his several children, as one of his
daughters had resided there since her marriage. There was every kind of
conveyance at the neighbouring village suited to the accommodation of
travellers, both summer and winter, and the rapid improvement of the
town had long been a current topic of the inhabitants as well as
visiters, while they praised the proprietor of the new pavilion, in his
manner of conducting it, and his excellent accommodations; and it was
the general opinion that in the course of a few years this would become
a place of no small consideration.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">At</span> length it became the unhappy fate
of America to be a second time involved in a war with Great Britain. “In
a manifesto of the president, the reasons of the war were stated to be
the impressment of American seamen, by the British; the blockade of the
enemy’s ports, supported by no adequate force; in consequence of which
the American commerce had been plundered in every sea; and the British
orders in council.”</p>

<p>The declaration of war was a source of unavoidable regret to the good
and wise president,<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href =
"#note1">*</a> which affected his mind with feelings approaching to
melancholy. No one possessed qualities more inclined to peace, and a
wish to settle all affairs of state in a pacific manner, more than he
did, if it were possible, and it could have been done without
sacrificing all the dearest rights and interests of the people; and
nothing but these repeated persuasions in his mind, founded on the
principles of justice and
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page39" id = "page39"
href = "#par_page39">39</a>
honour, caused him at length to be willing to yield to the stern
necessity of deciding the existing differences by combat. He possessed
the qualities of a statesman in an eminent degree; he had well reflected
on what he considered as inevitable. He was well versed in political
science, and now only saw the realization of anticipated events, of
which there had been sufficient warning. Although he had to contend with
innumerable difficulties, having once formed his opinion of what was to
be done, his patriotism was undeviating, and his integrity
inflexible.</p>

<p class = "footnote">
<a name = "note1" id = "note1" href = "#tag1">*</a> James Madison.</p>

<p>Since his country was again brought to a lamentable destiny, he now
became ardently active in its cause, and was prepared to carry to the
full extent such measures of defence and resistance as should be
necessary to repel every invasion of the just rights and privileges of
the Americans that they had long been in possession of since their
dear-bought independence, and could not therefore be willing to submit
to anything like oppression, even from the mother country.</p>

<p>This national calamity, that seemed to awaken feelings of hilarity to
some few among the multitude, but those of the deepest regret to so many
others, where the parties must at length become personally engaged and
animated against each other with an
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page40" id = "page40"

enthusiastic ardour, and with the hope to signalize themselves by their
bravery&mdash;where the impetuosity of youth and the experience of age
are called forth in open field to execute the decided discussions of
government, and to engage with patriotic zeal in the common defence of
their just rights and liberties; impelled with ambitious impulse to
enlist themselves under the proud banners of their country, while the
sound of martial music strikes a feeling of enthusiasm and enterprise to
the bosom of the patriot.</p>

<p>Thus, in the name and cause of honour, the youth, generous and brave,
with all those who are compelled to take arms, sally forth with the
ambitious hope to bear down at once all contending opposition, and give
themselves no time to reflect on the many disconsolate ones they leave
behind them, that, however deeply concerned, can neither engage or
assist in the shocking contest; while they go forward hastily to meet
the foe, and hosts are advancing to dispute with them the victory, and
they can indulge no thought concerning those who, when the battle is
over, may have to lament the loss of a father, brother, or some other
dear friend, and who mournfully await the decisive tidings, which
perhaps is to render them for ever disconsolate; while they remain a
prey to that incessant anguish which
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page41" id = "page41"

naturally awaits those who have lost, in this manner, their dearest

<p><span class = "firstword">Albert</span>, the brother of Alida, during
his residence in New-York, had formed an indissoluble friendship with a
young gentleman who had lately graduated at Columbia College. His name
was Theodore. He was about twenty years of age: he had been esteemed an
excellent student. His appearance was manly, open, and free. His eye
indicated a nobleness of mind; he was naturally cheerful, although his
aspect was tinged with melancholy, and his disposition was rather of the
romantic cast. His father was an eminent merchant in the city, and had
long been engaged in the various scenes of commerce. His son was
designed for the law; but as the students were allowed some vacant time
after their graduation before they entered upon their professional
studies, he thought to improve this interim in mutual friendly visits,
mingling sometimes with select parties in the amusements of the day, and
in travelling through some parts of the United States.</p>

<a class = "pagenum" name = "page45" id = "page45"
href = "#par_page45">45</a>
<p>The spring was advancing, and already began to shed its cheering
influences over the face of nature, when, after a long period of clouds
and darkness, the sun, with his illuminating beams, was chasing away the
gloomy remains of winter, and recalling again to life and animation the
innumerable beauties of creation.</p>

<p>The day was fixed on when Alida was to return to her native
residence. Albert was to attend her home, and he invited his friend
Theodore to accom&shy;pany him. It was evening when they arrived at the
house of Albert’s father, where they found considerable company
collected, as was customary on the celebration of his birth-day.</p>

<p>He received his children with gladness and joy, and Theodore with
friendly politeness.</p>

<p>“This meeting must be highly pleasing to you, miss,” said Theodore to
Alida, “after your long absence from home.” “It is so, indeed,” replied
she, “and highly gratifying to my father, to meet here his children, and
relations, on the annual occasion of celebrating his birth-day, when we
are honoured with so numerous a company of uncles, aunts, cousins,
nephews, and nieces, that one would suppose we were connected with half
the families in the state. And sometimes they do not all leave us, in
several weeks afterwards, and regale themselves in
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page46" id = "page46"
href = "#par_page46">46</a>
riding about the country and visiting the neighbours in the
vicinity.”</p>

<p>In the course of the evening they were joined by a number from the
neighbouring villages, and among the rest was the son of a gentleman who
had been long acquainted with the family. He was a gay young man; his
address was easy; his manners rather voluptuous than refined; confident,
but not ungraceful.</p>

<p>He led the ton in fashionable circles, and was quite a favourite with
the ladies generally. His name was Bonville. He had seen Alida long
before, but her additional graces since that time appeared far to exceed
his expectations.</p>

<p>Alida at sixteen displayed many pleasing attractions. Her height rose
to the majestic. She was tall and graceful, and her expressive features
were adorned with hair of light auburn, which hung about her neck in
natural ringlets; while her dark blue eyes, mingled at once the rays of
sprightly intelligence, and a pleasing affability.</p>

<p>She was arrayed on this occasion, in a dress of white muslin, richly
inwrought with needle-work. A&nbsp;silk embroidered sash surrounded her
waist, and she wore on her head a wreath of artificial flowers. Her
elder sisters manifested their pleasure in beholding the artless,
unadorned school-girl, metamorphosed
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page47" id = "page47"
href = "#par_page47">47</a>
to the interesting young lady of fascinating manners and amiable
deportment.</p>

<p>Social converse and rural amusements took up the greater part of the
evening, when the general conversation of the gentlemen turned upon a
topic in which they were all more or less interested, on what might be
the unhappy result of the present contest, in which the American nation
was engaged, which continued to engross their thoughts, and it was a
late hour when the company separated.</p>

<p>Those who remained behind accom&shy;panied Alida on the next Sabbath
to the village church, where they heard an able and sublime discourse
delivered by the parish minister; highly edifying to the understanding
and improving to the minds of the hearers.</p>

<p>This divine was fully competent in the possession of Christian
principles and knowledge for his arduous calling, and had a happy talent
of conveying them to others with effect, and communicating them in
persuasive eloquence, for the benefit and reformation of mankind.</p>

<p>His powers of intellect and sentiments were no less liberal and
enlarged, than they were ingenious and elegant. His aspect was serene,
and his manners were cheerful, and the unruffled calmness of his mind
bore the same character of exalted excellence,
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page48" id = "page48"
href = "#par_page48">48</a>
and gave testimony of a peaceful bosom, rich in good works.</p>

<p>He manifested a lively interest in the welfare of his congregation,
and by his genuine goodness and pious example made many proselytes.</p>

<p>It was his endeavour to unite the minds of the people in one
interest, and excite them to be zealous in the common cause of
Christianity, where each individual, acting for the benefit of the
whole, would find their own happiness blended with that of society in
general, and be blessed in the reciprocal communication of charity and
benevolence.</p>

</div>


<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> time now arrived when Theodore
was to enter upon his professional studies, and he became engaged in the
office of an eminent attorney in New-York. He frequently absented
himself, however, to accom&shy;pany Albert to visit his father’s family,
and since his acquaintance with Alida, there was a charm that attracted
him thither. If he had admired the manly virtues of the brother, could
he fail to adore the gentle graces of the sister? If all the sympathies
of the most ardent friendship had been drawn forth toward the former,
must not all the softer sensibilities of the heart be attracted by the
milder and more refined excellencies of the other?</p>

<p>Bonville had become the admirer of Alida; of course he and Theodore
sometimes met. He had made no serious pretensions, but his particularity
indicated something more than fashionable politeness. His manners, his
independent situation, entitled him to respect. “It is not probable,
therefore, that he will be objectionable to her friends, or to
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page50" id = "page50"
href = "#par_page50">50</a>
Alida herself,” said Theodore, with an involuntary sigh, and as his
visits became more frequent, an increasing anxiety took place in his
bosom. He wished her to remain single; the idea of losing her by
marriage, gave him inexpressible regret. What substitute could supply to
him the happy hours he had passed in her company? What charm could wing
the lingering moments when she was gone?</p>

<p>How different would be the scene when debarred from the unreserved
friendship and conversation of Alida. And unreserved it could not be,
were she not exclusively mistress of herself. But was there not
something of a more refined texture than friendship in his predilection
for the company of Alida? If so, why not avow it? His prospects, his
family, and of course his pretensions might not be inferior to those of
Bonville.</p>

<p>But perhaps he was preferred. His opportunities: his prior
acquaintance with the lady. Distance was no barrier to his addresses.
His visits became more and more frequent. Was it not then highly
probable that he had gained her affections?</p>

<p>Thus reasoned Theodore, but the reasoning tended not to allay the
tempest that was gathering in his bosom. He ordered his carriage, and
was in a short time at the seat of Alida’s father. It was summer, and
towards evening when he arrived.
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page51" id = "page51"
href = "#par_page51">51</a>
Alida was sitting by the window when he entered the hall. She arose and
received him with a smile. I&nbsp;have just been thinking of an
evening’s walk, said she, but had no one to attend me, and you have come
just in time to perform that office. I&nbsp;will order tea immediately,
while you rest from the fatigues of your journey.</p>

<p>When tea was served up, a servant entered the room with a letter
which he had found in the yard. Alida received it. “’Tis a letter,” said
she, which I sent by Bonville to a lady in the village, and the careless
man has lost it. Turning to Theodore, I&nbsp;forgot to tell you, that
your friend Bonville has been with us a few days; he left us this
morning. “My friend,” replied Theodore, hastily. “Is he not your
friend?” inquired Alida. “I&nbsp;beg pardon, madam,” said he “my mind
was absent.” “He requested us to present his respects to his friend
Theodore,” said she. Theodore bowed and turned the conversation.</p>

<p>They now walked out, and took a winding path which led through
pleasant fields until they reached the water, and continued to pursue
their way along the shore till they came to a beautiful and shady grove,
where the thick foliage afforded a delightful retreat from the warm rays
of the sun, and at the extremity of which was a sloping eminence, which
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page52" id = "page52"
href = "#par_page52">52</a>
commanded an extensive prospect of the surrounding country, part of
Long-Island sound and the junction of the bay with the eastern
river.</p>

<p>A soft and silent shower had descended. A&nbsp;thousand transitory
gems trembled upon the leafy foliage, glittering in the western ray.
A&nbsp;bright rainbow sat upon a southern cloud; the light gales
whispered among the branches, agitated the young harvest to billowy
motion, and moved the tops of the deep green forest with majestic
grandeur; while flocks, herds, and cottages were scattered over the
resplendent landscape.</p>

<p>“This is a most delightful scene,” said Alida. “It is, truly,”
replied Theodore, “do you think that New-York can boast of so charming a
prospect?” “Yes, one,” answered she, it is the walk on the battery, the
water prospect is similar to this, but the landscape is not so
variegated.</p>

<p>See that ship, Theodore, coming down the sound, how she ploughs
through the white foam, while the breezes flutter in the sails, varying
with the vivid rays of the sun. “Yes,” said Theodore, it bounds with
rapid motions over the waves, and ere the day has departed it will
probably safely reach the wharf of the city.</p>

<p>They walked leisurely around the hill, and then moved slowly towards
home. The sun was sinking
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page53" id = "page53"
href = "#par_page53">53</a>
gradually behind the western horizon. Twilight arose dimly in the east,
and floated along the air. Darkness began to hover around the woodlands
and valleys. The beauties of the landscape slowly receded; the breezes
had gone down with the sun, and a perfect calm succeeded.</p>

<p>“I shall never forget this charming promenade,” said Theodore, as he
approached the threshold of the door, with a deep drawn sigh, “and the
remembrance of the sweet pensive scenery of this delightful spot, will
ever continue to haunt my memory.”</p>

</div>


<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> next day Theodore returned to
his studies; but different from his former visits to Alida, instead of
exhilarating his spirits, this had tended to depress them. He doubted
whether she was not already engaged to Bonville. His hopes would
persuade him this was not the case; but his fears declared
otherwise.</p>

<p>It was some time before he renewed his visits again. In the interim
he received a letter from a friend in the neighbourhood of Alida’s
father; an extract from which follows: “We are soon to have a wedding
here; you are acquainted with the parties&mdash;Alida M. and Bonville.
Such at least is our opinion from appearances, as this gentleman is now
there more than half his time. You will undoubtedly be invited. We had
expected that you would have put in your claims, from your particular
attention to the lady. She is a fine girl, Theodore.” I&nbsp;shall never
be a guest at Alida’s wedding, said Theodore, as he hastily paced the
room; but I must again
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page55" id = "page55"
href = "#par_page55">55</a>
see her before that event takes place, when I shall lose her
forever.</p>

<p>The ensuing day he repaired to her father’s. He inquired for Alida;
she was gone with a party to the shores of the sound, attended by
Bonville. At evening they returned. Bonville and Theodore addressed each
other with much seeming cordiality. “You have deserted us, Theodore,”
said Alida, “we concluded you had forgotten the road to this place.”
“Was not that a hasty conclusion?” said Theodore. “I&nbsp;think not,”
she answered, “if your long absence should be construed into neglect.
But we will hear your excuse,” said she, smiling, “by and by, and
perhaps pardon you.”</p>

<p>He thanked her for her condescension.</p>

<p>The next morning Bonville set out to go to New-York. Theodore
observed that he took particular leave of Alida, telling her, in a low
voice, that he should have the happiness of seeing her again, within two
or three weeks certainly.</p>

<p>After he was gone, as Alida and Theodore were sitting in the room
alone, “Well,” said she, “am I to hear your excuses, Theodore?” “For
what, madam?” “For neglecting your friends.” “I&nbsp;hope it is not so
considered, madam.” “Seriously, then, why have you stayed away so long?
Has
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page56" id = "page56"
href = "#par_page56">56</a>
this place no charms in the absence of my brother?”</p>

<p>“Would my presence have added to your felicity, Alida?” “You never
came an unwelcome visiter here.” “Perhaps I might be sometimes intrusive
when Bonville is your guest.” “I&nbsp;have supposed you were on friendly
terms,” said she. “We are, but there are seasons when friendship must
yield its pretensions to a superior claim.”</p>

<p>“Will you answer me one question, Alida, are you engaged to
Bonville?” “He has asked me the same question concerning you,” replied
she, (blushing.)</p>

<p>“Do you,” continued Theodore, “prefer him to any other?” Alida,
(blushing deeply.) “He has made the same inquiries respecting you.”</p>

<p>“I beg, madam, you will deal with me candidly,” said Theodore,
(taking her hand with anxiety.) “I&nbsp;am entitled to no claims, but
you know what my heart would ask. I&nbsp;will bow to your decision.
Bonville or Theodore must relinquish their pretensions. We cannot share
the blessing.”</p>

<p>The cheeks of Alida were suffused with a varying glow, her lips were
pale, her voice tremulous, and her eyes cast down. “My father has
informed me,” she said, “that it is improper to receive the particular
addresses of more than one. I&nbsp;am conscious
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page57" id = "page57"
href = "#par_page57">57</a>
of my inadvertency, and that the reproof is just. One, therefore, must
be dismissed.” But, (she blushed deeper,) and a considerable pause
ensued.</p>

<p>At length Theodore arose. “I will not press you further,” said he.
“I&nbsp;know the delicacy of your feelings; I&nbsp;know your sincerity;
I&nbsp;will not therefore insist on your performing the painful task of
deciding against me. Your conduct in every point of view has been
discreet. I&nbsp;would have no just claims, or if I had, your heart must
sanction them, or they would be unhallowed, and unjustifiable.
I&nbsp;shall ever pray for your felicity. Our affections are not under
our direction; our happiness depends on our obedience to their mandates.
Whatever, then, may be my sufferings, you are unblameable, and
irreproachable.”</p>

<p>He took his hat in extreme agitation, and prepared himself to take
leave. Alida had recovered in some degree from her embarrassment, and
collected her scattered spirits.</p>

<p>“Your conduct, Theodore,” said she, “is generous and noble. Will you
give yourself the trouble, and do me the honour to see me once more?”
“I&nbsp;will,” said he, “at any time you shall appoint.”</p>

<p>“Four weeks, then,” said she, “from this day,
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page58" id = "page58"
href = "#par_page58">58</a>
honour me with a visit, and you shall have my decision, and receive my
final answer.” “I&nbsp;will be punctual to the day,” he replied, and
bade her adieu.</p>

<p>Theodore’s hours from this time winged heavily away. His wonted
cheerfulness fled; he wooed the silent and solitary haunts of musing,
moping melancholy. He loved to wander through lonely fields, when dewy
twilight robed the evening mild, or to trace the forest glen, through
which the moon darted her silvery intercepted rays. His agitated
thoughts preyed upon his peace incessantly, and deeply disturbed his
repose.</p>

<p>He looked anxiously to the hour when Alida was to make the decision.
He wished, yet dreaded the event. In that he foresaw, or thought he
foresaw, a&nbsp;withering blight to all his hopes, and a final
consummation to his foreboding fears. He had pressed Alida, perhaps too
urgently, to a declaration. Had her predilection been in his favour,
would she have hesitated to avow it? Her father had advised her to
relinquish one, and to retain the other, nor had he attempted to
influence or direct her choice. Was it not evident, then, from her
confused hesitation and embarrassment, when solicited to discriminate
upon the subject, that her ultimate decision would be in favour of
Bonville?</p>

<a class = "pagenum" name = "page59" id = "page59"
href = "#par_page59">59</a>
<p>While Theodore’s mind was thus in agitation, he received a second
letter from his friend in the neighbourhood of Alida. He read the
following clause therein with emotions more easily to be conceived than
expressed: “Alida’s wedding-day is appointed. I&nbsp;need not tell you
that Bonville is to be the happy deity of the hymenial sacrifice.
I&nbsp;had it from his own declaration. He did not name the positive
day, but it is certainly to be soon. You will undoubtedly, however, have
timely notice, and receive an invitation.”</p>

<p>“We must pour out a liberal libation upon the mystic altar, Theodore,
and twine the nuptial garland with wreaths of joy. Bonville should
devote a rich offering to so valuable a prize. He has been here for a
week, and departed for New-York yesterday, but is shortly to
return.”</p>

<p>And why have I ever doubted this event? said Theodore. What
infatuation hath then led me on in the pursuit of fantastic and unreal
bliss? I&nbsp;have had, it is true, no positive assurances that Alida
would be disposed to favour my addresses. But why did she ever receive
them? Why did she enchantingly smile upon me? Why fascinate the soft
powers of my heart by that winning mildness, and the favourable display
of those complicated and superior attractions which she must have known
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page60" id = "page60"
href = "#par_page60">60</a>
were irresistible? And now she would have me dance attendance to her
decision in favour of another&mdash;insulting; let Bonville and herself
make it, as they have formed this farcical decision. I&nbsp;absolutely
will never attend it. Why did she not spurn me from her confidence, and
plainly tell me that my attentions were untimely and improper?</p>

<p>But, I have engaged to see her at an appointed time; my honour is
therefore pledged for an interview; it must take place. I&nbsp;shall
endeavour to support it with becoming dignity, and I will convince Alida
and Bonville, that I am not the dupe of their caprices. But, let me
consider&mdash;What has Alida done to deserve censure or reproach? Her
brother was my early friend; she has treated me as a friend to that
brother. She was unconscious of the affection which her charms and
mental graces had kindled in my bosom. Her evident embarrassment, on
receiving my declaration, witnessed her surprise and prior attachment.
What could she do to save herself the pain of a direct denial? She has
appointed a day when her refusal may come in a more delicate and formal
manner&mdash;and I must therefore meet&nbsp;it.</p>

The time draws near when I shall meet those eyes, that may perchance
look cold on me&mdash;“but doubt is called the beacon of the wise, the
<ins class = "correction" title = "text unchanged: standard reading is ‘tent that searches’">test that reaches</ins> to the bottom of the
worst.”</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">On</span> the appointed day, Theodore
proceeded to the house of Alida’s father, where he arrived late in the
afternoon. Alida had retired to a little summer-house at the end of the
garden. A&nbsp;servant conducted him thither.</p>

<p>She was dressed in a flowing robe of white muslin, richly
embroidered. Her hair was in dishevelled curls; she was contemplating a
bouquet of flowers which she held in her hand. Theodore fancied she
never appeared so lovely. She arose to receive him.</p>

<p>We have been expecting you for some time, said she; we were anxious
to inform you that we have just received a letter from my brother, in
which he desires us to present you his most friendly respects, and
complains of your not visiting him lately so frequently as usual.
Theodore thanked her for the information; said that business had
prevented him; he esteemed him as his most valuable friend, and would be
more particular in future.</p>

<p>“We have been thronged with company several
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page62" id = "page62"
href = "#par_page62">62</a>
days,” said Alida. The last of them took their departure yesterday. And
I have only to regret, that I have nearly a week been prevented from
taking my favourite walk to the grove, to which place you attended me
when you were last here. “We will walk there, then, if you have no
objections, as no doubt it is much improved since that time,” said
Theodore. They resorted thither towards evening, and seated themselves
in the arbour where they sat some time contemplating the scenery.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of autumn, and a yellow hue was spread over the
natural beauties of creation. The withering forest began to shed its
decaying foliage, which the light gales pursued along the russet
fields;&mdash;the low sun extended its lengthening
shadows;&mdash;curling smoke ascended from the neighbouring village and
the surrounding cottages;&mdash;a&nbsp;thick fog crept along the
valleys;&mdash;a&nbsp;grey mist hovered over the tops of the distant
hills;&mdash;the glassy surface of the water glittering to the sun’s
departing ray;&mdash;the solemn herds lowed in monotonous
symphony;&mdash;the autumnal insects, in sympathetic wafting,
plaintively predicted their approaching fate.</p>

<p>The scene is changed since we last visited this place, said Alida;
“the gay charms of summer are
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page63" id = "page63"
href = "#par_page63">63</a>
beginning to decay, and must soon yield their splendours to the rude
despoiling hand of winter.”</p>

<p>“That will be the case,” said Theodore, “before I shall have the
pleasure of your company here again.” “That may probably be, though it
is nearly two months yet to winter,” said Alida.</p>

<p>“Great changes may take place within that time,” said Theodore. Yes,
changes must take place, she answered, but nothing, I&nbsp;hope to
embitter present prospects.</p>

<p>As it respects yourself, I trust not, madam. “And I sincerely hope
not, as it respects you, Theodore.” That wish, said he, I&nbsp;believe
is vain.</p>

<p>Your feelings accord with the season, Theodore; you are melancholy.
Shall we return?</p>

<p>“I ask your pardon, madam; I know I am unsociable. You speak of
returning; you know the occasion of my being here. You cannot have
forgotten your own appointment and consequent engagement?” She made no
answer.</p>

<p>I know, Alida, that you are incapable of duplicity or evasion.
I&nbsp;have promised and now repeat the declaration, that I will
silently submit to your decision. This you have engaged to make, and
this is the time you have appointed. The pain of present suspense can
scarcely be surpassed by the pang of disappointment. On your part you
have
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page64" id = "page64"
href = "#par_page64">64</a>
nothing to fear. I&nbsp;trust you have candidly determined, and will
decide explicitly.</p>

<p>“I am placed in an exceedingly delicate situation,” answered Alida,
(sighing.) “I&nbsp;know you are, madam,” said Theodore, “but your own
honour, your own peace, require that you should extricate yourself from
the perplexing embarrassment.”</p>

<p>“That I am convinced of,” replied she. “I&nbsp;know that I have been
inadvertently indiscreet. I&nbsp;have admitted the addresses of Bonville
and yourself, without calculating or expecting the consequences. You
have both treated me honourably and with respect. You are both on equal
grounds as to standing in life. With Bonville I became first acquainted.
As it relates to him, some new arrangements have taken place since you
came here.”</p>

<p>Theodore interrupted her with emotion. “Of those arrangements I am
acquainted, I&nbsp;received the intelligence from a friend in your
neighbourhood. I&nbsp;am prepared for the event.”</p>

<p>Alida remained silent. “I have mentioned before,” resumed Theodore,
“that whatever may be your decision, no impropriety can attach to you.
I&nbsp;might add, indeed, from various circumstances, and from the
information I possess, I&nbsp;perhaps should not have given you further
trouble on the occasion, had it not been from your own direction. And I
am
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page65" id = "page65"
href = "#par_page65">65</a>
now willing to retire without further explanation, without giving you
the pain of an express decision, if you think the measure expedient.
Your declaration can only be a matter of form, the consequence of which
I know, and my proposition may save your feelings.”</p>

<p>“No, Theodore,” replied she, “my reputation depends on my adherence
to my first determination; justice to yourself and to Bonville also
demand it. After what has passed, I&nbsp;should be considered as acting
capriciously, and inconsistently, should I depart from it. Bonville will
be here to-morrow, and you must consent to stay with us until that time;
the matter shall then be decided.” “Yes,” said Theodore, “it shall be as
you say, madam. Make your arrangements as you please.”</p>

<p>Evening came on, and spread around her sombre shades;&mdash;the
breeze’s rustling wing was in the tree:&mdash;the sound of the low,
murmuring brooks, and the far-off waterfall, were faintly
heard;&mdash;the frequent lights in the village darted their pale lustre
through the gloom:&mdash;the solitary whip-poor-wills stationed
themselves along the woody glens, the groves and rocky pastures, and
sung a requiem to departed summer;&mdash;a&nbsp;dark cloud was rising in
the west, across whose gloomy front the vivid lightning bent its forky
spires.</p>

<a class = "pagenum" name = "page66" id = "page66"
href = "#par_page66">66</a>
<p>Theodore and Alida moved slowly towards home; she appeared enraptured
with the melancholy splendours of the evening, but another subject
engaged the mental attention of Theodore.</p>

<p>Bonville arrived the next day. He gave his hand to Theodore with
seeming warmth of friendship. If it was reciprocated, it must have been
affected. There was no alteration in the manners and conversation of
Alida; her discourse, as usual, was sprightly and interesting. After
dinner she retired, and her father requested Theodore and Bonville to
withdraw with him to a private room. After they were seated, the old
gentleman thus addressed them:</p>

<p>“I have called you here, gentlemen, to perform my duty as a parent to
my daughter, and as a friend to you. You have both addressed Alida;
while your addresses were merely formal, they were innocent; but when
they became serious, they were dangerous. Your pretensions I consider
equal, and between honourable pretenders, who are worthy of my daughter,
I&nbsp;shall not attempt to influence her choice. That choice, however,
can rest only on one; she has engaged to decide between you. I&nbsp;am
come, to make in her name this decision. The following are my terms: no
difficulty shall arise between you, gentlemen, in consequence of her
determination; nothing shall go abroad respecting the
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page67" id = "page67"
href = "#par_page67">67</a>
affair; it shall be settled under my roof. As soon as I have pronounced
Alida’s declaration, you shall both depart, and absent my house for at
least two weeks, as it would be improper for my daughter to see either
of you at present; after that period I shall be happy to receive your
visits.” Theodore and Bonville pledged their honour to abide implicitly
by these injunctions.</p>

<p>He then further observed: “This, gentlemen, is all I require.
I&nbsp;have said that I considered your pretensions equal; so has my
daughter treated them. You have both made professions to her; she has
appointed a time to answer you. That time has now arrived, and I now
inform you&mdash;that she has decided in favour of Theodore.”</p>

<p>These words from Alida’s father, burst upon the mental powers of
Bonville like sudden and tremendous thunder on the deep and sullen
silence of night. Unaccustomed to disappointment, he had calculated on
assured success. His addresses to the ladies generally had been
honourably received. Alida was the first whose charms were capable of
rendering them sincere. He was not ignorant of Theodore’s attentions to
her; it gave him, however, but little uneasiness. He believed that his
superior acquired graces would eclipse the pretensions of his rival. He
considered himself a connoisseur in character,
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page68" id = "page68"
href = "#par_page68">68</a>
especially in that of the ladies. He conformed to their taste; he
flattered their foibles, and obsequiously bowed to the minutia of female
volatility. He considered himself skilled in the language of the heart;
and he trusted that from his pre-eminent powers in the science of
affection, he had only to see, to make use of, and to conquer.</p>

<p>He had frankly offered his hand to Alida, and pressed her for a
decisive answer. This from time to time she suspended, and finally named
a day in which to give him and Theodore a determinate one, though
neither knew the arrangements made with the other. Alida finding,
however, the dilemma in which she was placed, and she had previously
consulted her father. He had no objections to her choosing between two
persons of equal claims to affluence and respectability. This choice she
had made, and her father was considered the most proper person to
pronounce&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>When Bonville had urged Alida to answer him decidedly, he supposed
that her hesitation, delay and suspensions, were only the effect of
diffidence. He had no suspicion of her ultimate conclusion, and when she
finally named the day to decide, he was confident her voice would be in
his favour. These sentiments he had communicated to the person who had
written to Theodore, intimating that Alida had
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page69" id = "page69"
href = "#par_page69">69</a>
fixed a time which was to crown his sanguine wishes. He had listened,
therefore, attentively to the words of her father, momen&shy;tarily
expecting to hear himself declared the favourite choice of the fair.
What then must have been his disappointment when the name of Theodore
was pronounced instead of his own! The highly-finished scene of pleasure
and future happy prospects which his ardent imagination had depicted,
now vanished in a moment. The bright sun of his early hopes was veiled
in darkness at this unexpected decision.</p>

<p>Very different were the sensations which inspired the bosom of
Theodore. He had not even calculated on a decision in his favour; he
believed that Bonville would be the choice of Alida. She had told him,
that the form of deciding was necessary to save appearances; with this
form he complied, because she desired it, not because he expected the
result would be in his favour. He had not, therefore, attended to the
words of Alida’s father with that eagerness which favourable
anticipations commonly produce.</p>

<p>But when his name was mentioned; when he found that he was the
choice, the happy favourite of Alida’s affection, every ardent feeling
of his soul became interested, and was suddenly aroused to the
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page70" id = "page70"
href = "#par_page70">70</a>
refinements of sensibility. Like an electric shock it re-animated his
existence, and the bright morning of joy quickly dissipated the gloom
which hung over his mind.</p>

</div>


<p><span class = "firstword">Several</span> weeks passed away, and
Theodore felt all that anxiety and impatience which a separation from a
beloved object can produce. He framed a thousand excuses to visit Alida,
yet he feared a visit might be premature. He was, however, necessitated
to make a journey to a distant part of the country, after which he
resolved to see her.</p>

<p>He performed the business he went on, and was returning. It was
toward evening, and the day had been uncommonly sultry for the autumnal
season. A&nbsp;rising shower blackened the western hemisphere; the dark
vapours ascended in folding ridges, and the thunder rolled at a
distance.</p>

<p>Theodore saw he should be overtaken by the rain. He discovered an
elegant seat about a hundred yards distant from the road; thither he
hastened to gain shelter from the approaching storm.</p>

<p>The owner of the mansion met him at the door, and politely invited
him in, while a servant stood ready to take his horse.</p>

<a class = "pagenum" name = "page72" id = "page72"
href = "#par_page72">72</a>
<p>He was ushered into a large apartment, genteelly furnished, where the
family and several young ladies were sitting. As he glanced his eye
hastily around the room, he thought he recognized a familiar
countenance. A&nbsp;hurried succession of confused ideas for a moment
crossed his recollection. In a moment he discovered that it was
Alida.</p>

<p>By this unexpected meeting they were both completely embarrassed.
Alida, however, arose, and, in rather a confused manner, introduced
Theodore to the company as the friend of her brother.</p>

<p>The rain continued most part of the afternoon. Theodore was urged by
the family, and consented to stay the night. A&nbsp;moonlight evening
succeeded the shower, which invited the young people to walk in an
adjoining garden. Alida informed Theodore that the owner of the mansion
was a distant relative of her father, who had two amiable daughters, not
far from her own age. She had been invited there to pass a week, and
expected to return within two days. “And,” she added, smiling, “perhaps,
Theodore, we may have an opportunity once more to visit our favourite
grove, before winter entirely destroys the remaining beauties of the
summer.”</p>

<p>Theodore felt all the force of the remark. He recollected the
conversation when they were last at
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page73" id = "page73"
href = "#par_page73">73</a>
the place she mentioned; and he well remembered his feelings on that
occasion.</p>

<p>“Great changes, indeed,” he replied, “have taken place since we were
last there;&mdash;that they are productive of unexpected and unexampled
happiness to me, is due, Alida, to yourself alone.”</p>

<p>Theodore departed next morning, appointing the next week to visit
Alida at her father’s house. Thus were the obstacles removed which had
presented a barrier to their united wishes. They had not, it is true,
been separated by wide seas, unfeeling parents, nor, as yet, by the
rigorous laws of war; but vexations, doubts, and difficulties had thus
far attended them, which had now happily disappeared, and they
calculated on no unpropitious event which might thwart their future
happiness.</p>

<p>All the hours that Theodore could spare from his studies were devoted
to Alida; and their parents began to calculate on joining their hands as
soon as his professional term of study was completed.</p>

<p>Hostilities that had previously commenced with England had been
followed by several battles. “The panic and general bustle which
prevailed at this time, will yet be remembered by many.” These
circumstances were not calculated to impress the mind of Alida with the
most pleasant sensations. She foresaw that the burden of the war must
rest
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page74" id = "page74"
href = "#par_page74">74</a>
on the American youth, and she trembled in anticipation for the fate of
Theodore. He, with others, should it continue, must take the field in
defence of his country. The effects of such a separation were dubious
and gloomy. Theodore and herself frequently discoursed on the subject,
and they agreed to form the mystic union previous to any wide
separation. One event tended to hasten this resolution: The attorney in
whose office Theodore was engaged received a commission in the
new-raised American army, and marched to the lines near Boston. His
business was therefore suspended, and Theodore returned to the house of
his father. He considered that he could not remain long a mere spectator
of the contest, and that it might soon become his duty to take the
field, therefore concluded to hasten his marriage with Alida. She
consented to the proposition, and their parents made the necessary
arrangements for the event. The place was fixed upon which was to be
their future residence. It was a pleasantly situated eminence,
commanding an extensive prospect. On the west, forests unevenly lifted
their rude heads, with here and there a solitary field, newly cleared,
and thinly scattered with cottages. To the east, the eye extended over a
soil at one time swelling into woody elevations, and at another
spreading itself into vales of the most enchanting
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page75" id = "page75"
href = "#par_page75">75</a>
verdure. To the north it extended to the palisades, wooded to their
summits, and throwing their shadows over intervals of equal wilderness,
till at length the eye, wandering far beyond, was arrested in its
excursions by the blue mist which hovered over the distant mountains,
more grand, majestic, and lofty. The inhabitants around were mild,
sociable, moral, and diligent. The produce of their own fields gave them
the most of what was necessary, and they were happily free from all
dissipation and luxury.</p>

<p>Such was the site marked out for the residence of Theodore and Alida.
They visited the spot, and were enraptured with its pensive, romantic
beauties.</p>

<p>“Here,” said Theodore, “we will one day pass our time in all the
felicity of mind which the chequered scenes of life will admit. In the
spring, we will roam among the flowers; in summer, we will gather
strawberries in yonder fields, or raspberries from the adjacent
shrubbery. The breezes of fragrant morning and the sighs of the evening
gale will be mingled with the songs of the various birds which frequent
the surrounding groves. We will gather the bending fruits of autumn, and
will listen with pleasure to the hoarse, murmuring voice of
winter&mdash;its whistling winds, its driving snow and rattling
hail&mdash;with delight.”</p>

<a class = "pagenum" name = "page76" id = "page76"
href = "#par_page76">76</a>
<p>The bright gems of joy glistened in the eyes of Alida as Theodore
described this pleasing scene of anticipation.</p>

<p>Winter came on; it rapidly passed away. Spring advanced, and the
marriage day was appointed. Preparations for the hymenial ceremony were
making, and invitations had already gone abroad. Albert was particularly
sent for, and all was approaching to readiness for this happy event.</p>

<p>Theodore and Alida again promenaded to the spot which had been chosen
for their habitation; they projected the structure of the buildings,
planned the gardens, the artificial groves, the walks, and the green
retreat of the summer-house; and already they realized in imagination
the various domestic blessings and felicities with which they were to be
surrounded.</p>

<p>Nature was adorned with the bridal ornaments of spring; the radiant
sun was sinking behind the groves, casting his sable shades over the
valley, while the retiring beams of day adorned the distant eastern
eminences with yellow lustre; the birds sung melodiously in the grove;
the air was freshened by light western breezes, bearing upon their wings
all the entrancing odours of the season; while around the horizon clouds
raised their brazen summits, based in the black vapour of approaching
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page77" id = "page77"
href = "#par_page77">77</a>
night; and as its darkening shades were advancing, Theodore and Alida
returned home. They seated themselves awhile on the piazza, to
contemplate the splendours of the evening, and to witness the beauties
of one of the most picturesque draperies painted in the landscape of
nature.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> tumults of a second war with
Great Britain still increased, and was not only exhausting the finances
of the country, but called for a still greater sacrifice&mdash;all the
bravest American youth. A&nbsp;large army of reinforcements was shortly
expected from England to land on our shores, and the confused noise of
the warriors, with more vigorous and intrepid combat, were already
anticipated.</p>

<p>Theodore had received a commission in a regiment of militia, and was
pressed by several young gentlemen of his acquaintance, who had enlisted
in the army, to join it also. He had an excuse: his father was a man in
extensive business, was considerably past the prime of life, had a
number of agents and clerks under him, but began to feel himself unable
to attend to the various and burthensome duties and demands of a
mercantile life.
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page79" id = "page79"
href = "#par_page79">79</a>
Theodore was his only son; his assistance, therefore, became necessary,
until, at least, his father could bring his business to a close, which
he was now about to effect.</p>

<p>Theodore stated these facts to his friends; told them that on every
occasion he should be ready to fly to the post of danger when his
country was invaded, and that as soon as his father’s affairs became
settled, he would, if necessary, join the army.</p>

<p>The president was now active in making every exertion in his power,
to rouse the feelings of his countrymen to act their parts with honour
in the scene that was now before them. He knew that much of the
responsibility rested on himself. The capacity he was in with regard to
the nation, caused the most material and important business&mdash;of
directing and superintending the weighty affairs of government&mdash;to
fall upon his hands; and such was the situation of the country, that it
not only called for the exertion, the wisdom, sound judgment, and policy
of the presidential chair, but likewise of every patriotic bosom to
participate in their endeavours to oppose the depredations against it.
The chief executive was entered on a theatre in which he was to act a
conspicuous part in this war of America with Great Britain, and to
occupy a station in the page of history, where the interesting
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page80" id = "page80"
href = "#par_page80">80</a>
detail will reach the ear of remotest ages in the dates of time.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the father of Theodore had been absent for three or
four days to one of the commercial seaports, on business with some
merchants with whom he was connected in trade. He returned the next day
after Theodore had got home; his aspect and his conversation were marked
with an assumed and unmeaning cheerfulness. At supper he ate nothing,
discoursed much, but in an unconnected and hurried manner, interrupted
by long pauses, in which he appeared to be buried in contemplation.
After supper he asked Theodore “if it were not possible that his union
with Alida could be concluded within a few days?” Theodore, startled at
so unexpected a question, replied, that such a proposal would be
considered extraordinary, perhaps improper; besides, when Alida had
named the day, she mentioned that she had an uncle who lived at a
distance, whose daughter was to pass the summer with her, and was
expected to arrive before the appointed time. It would, he said, be a
delicate thing for him to anticipate the nuptials, unless he could give
some cogent reason for so doing, and at present he was not apprised that
any such existed. His father, after a few moments’ hesitation, answered,
“I&nbsp;have reasons which, when
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page81" id = "page81"
href = "#par_page81">81</a>
told,”&mdash;here he stopped, suddenly arose, hastily walked the room in
much visible agony of mind, and then retired to his chamber.</p>

<p>Theodore and his mother were much amazed at so strange a proceeding.
They could form no conjecture of its cause, or its consequence. Theodore
passed a sleepless night. His father’s slumbers were interrupted; he was
restless and uneasy: his sleep was broken and disturbed by incoherent
mutterings and plaintive moans. In the morning when he appeared at
breakfast, his countenance wore the marks of dejection and anguish. He
scarcely spoke a word; and after the cloth was removed, he ordered all
to withdraw except Theodore and his mother; when, with emotions that
spoke the painful feelings of his bosom, he thus addressed them:</p>

<p>“For more than thirty years I have been engaged in commerce, in order
to acquire independence for myself and my family. To accomplish this,
I&nbsp;became connected with some English importing merchants, in a
seaport town, and went largely into the English trade. Success crowned
our endeavours. On balancing our accounts, two years ago, we found that
our expectations were answered, and that we were sufficiently wealthy to
close business, which some proposed to do; it was, however, agreed to
make one effort more, as some
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page82" id = "page82"
href = "#par_page82">82</a>
favourable circumstances appeared to offer, in which we adventured very
largely, on a fair calculation of liberal and extensive proceeds. Before
returns could be made, the war came on, embarrassments ensued, and by
indubitable intelligence lately received, we find that our property in
England has been sequestered; five of our ships, laden with English
goods, lying in English harbours, and just ready to sail for America,
have been seized as lawful prizes; added to this, three vessels from the
Indies, laden with island produce, have been taken on their homeward
bound voyage, and one lost on her return from Holland.</p>

<p>“This wreck of fortune I might have survived, had I to sustain only
my equal dividend of the loss; but of the merchants with whom I have
been connected, not one remains to share the fate of the event&mdash;all
have absconded or secreted themselves. To attempt to compound with my
creditors would be of little avail, so that the consequence to me is
inevitable ruin.</p>

<p>“To abscond would not secure me, as most of my remaining property is
vested in real estate; and even if it would, I&nbsp;could not consent to
it. I&nbsp;could not consent to banish myself from my country, with the
view to defraud my creditors. No: I&nbsp;have lived honestly, and
honestly will I die. By
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page83" id = "page83"
href = "#par_page83">83</a>
fair application and industry my wealth has been obtained, and it shall
never justly be said that the reputation of my latter days were sullied
with acts of meanness. I&nbsp;have notified and procured a meeting of
the creditors, and have laid the matter before them. Some appeared
favourable to me, others insinuated that we were all connected in
fraudulent designs to swindle our creditors. To this I replied with
becoming spirit, and was in consequence threatened with immediate
prosecution. Whatever may be the event, I&nbsp;had some hopes that your
happiness, Theodore, might yet be secured. Hence I proposed your union
with Alida before our misfortunes should be promulgated. Your parents
are old, a&nbsp;little will serve the residue of their days. With your
acquirements you may make your way in life. I&nbsp;shall now have no
property to give you; but I would still wish you to ensure to yourself
that which you prize far above, and without which, both honours and
emoluments would be unimportant and worthless.”</p>

<p>At this moment a loud rap at the door interrupted the discourse, and
three men were ushered in, which proved to be the sheriff and his
attendants, sent by the more inexorable creditors of Theodore’s father
and company, to levy on the property of the former, which orders they
faithfully executed by
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page84" id = "page84"
href = "#par_page84">84</a>
seizing the lands, tenements, and furniture. We will not stop the reader
to moralize on this disastrous event&mdash;the feelings of the family
can better be conceived than described.</p>

<p>Hurled, in a moment, from the lofty summit of affluence to the low
vale of indigence, Christian philosophy after a while came to the aid of
the parents, but who can realize the feelings of the son? Thus suddenly
cut short, not only of his prospects of future independence, but even
present support, what would be the event of his suit to Alida, and
stipulated marriage? Was it not probable that her father would now
cancel the contract? Could she consent to become his in his present
penurious situation? and could he himself be willing to make her
miserable?</p>

<p>In this agitated frame of mind he received a letter from a friend in
the neighbourhood of Alida, requesting him to come immediately to his
house, whither he repaired the following day.</p>

<p>This person had ever been the unchanging friend of Theodore; he had
heard of the misfortunes of his family, and he deeply sympathized in his
distress. He had lately married and settled near the residence of
Alida’s father. His name was Raymond. When Theodore arrived at the house
of his friend, he was received with the same disinterested
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page85" id = "page85"
href = "#par_page85">85</a>
ardour he had ever been before, in the day of his most unbounded
prosperity. After being seated, Raymond told him the occasion of his
sending for him was to propose the adoption of certain measures which he
doubted not might be considered highly beneficial, as it respected his
future peace and happiness. “Your family misfortunes,” continued he,
“have reached the ear of Alida’s father. I&nbsp;know old people,
generally speaking, too well to believe he will now consent to receive
you as his son-in-law under your present embarrassments. The case is
difficult, but not insurmountable. You must first see Alida; she is now
in the next room; I&nbsp;will introduce you in; converse with her, after
which I will lay my plan before you.”</p>

<p>Theodore entered the room. Alida was sitting by a window which looked
into a pleasant garden, and over verdant meadows where tall grass waved
to the evening breeze; further on, low valleys spread their umbrageous
thickets where the dusky shadows of night had began to assemble. On the
high hills beyond, the tops of lofty forests, majestically moved by the
billowy gales, caught the sun’s last ray. Fleecy summer clouds hovered
around the verge of the western horizon, spangled with silvery tints or
fringed with the gold of evening. A&nbsp;mournfully murmuring rivulet
purled at a little distance
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page86" id = "page86"
href = "#par_page86">86</a>
from the garden, on the borders of a small grove, from whence the
American wild dove wafted her sympathetic moaning to the ear of Alida.
She was leaning on a small table as she sat by the window, which was
thrown up. Her attention was fixed. She did not perceive Raymond and
Theodore as they entered. They advanced towards her; she turned,
started, and arose. With a melancholy smile she said she supposed it was
Mrs. Raymond who was approaching, as she had just left the room. Her
countenance was dejected, which, on seeing Theodore, lighted up into a
languid sprightliness. It was evident she had been weeping. Raymond
retired, and Theodore and Alida seated themselves.</p>

<p>“I have broken in upon your solitude, perhaps too unseasonably,” said
Theodore. It is however the fault of Raymond; he invited me to walk into
the room, but did not inform me that you were alone.</p>

<p>“Your presence was sudden and unexpected, but not unseasonable,”
replied Alida. I&nbsp;hope that you did not consider any formality
necessary in your visits, Theodore?</p>

<p>“I once did not think so,” answered Theodore; now I know not what to
think&mdash;I&nbsp;know not how to act. You have heard of the
misfortunes of my father’s family, Alida?</p>

<a class = "pagenum" name = "page87" id = "page87"
href = "#par_page87">87</a>
<p>“Yes, I have heard the circumstances attending that event,” said she;
an event in which no one could be more deeply interested, except the
immediate sufferers, than myself.</p>

<p>“Your father is also acquainted with my present situation,” said
Theodore; and how did he receive the intelligence?</p>

<p>“With deep regret,” replied Alida.</p>

<p>Has he forbidden you to admit my addresses any longer? if even in an
unqualified or indirect manner, it is proper I should know&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>“It certainly is,” said Alida. Soon after we received the
intelligence of your family misfortunes, my father came into the room
where I was sitting: ‘Alida,’ said he, ‘your conduct has ever been that
of a dutiful child,&mdash;mine, of an indulgent parent. My ultimate wish
is to see my children, when settled in life, happy and honourably
respected. For this purpose I have bestowed on them a proper education,
and design suitably to apportion my property among them. On their part,
it is expected they will act prudently and discreetly, especially in
those things which concern materially their future peace and welfare:
the principal requisite to insure this is a proper connexion in
marriage.’ Here my father paused a considerable time, and then
continued: ‘I&nbsp;know, my child, that your situation
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page88" id = "page88"
href = "#par_page88">88</a>
is a very delicate one. Your marriage-day is appointed; it was named
under the fairest prospects. By the failure of Theodore’s father, those
prospects have become deeply darkened, if not totally obliterated. To
commit your fortune through life to a person in his present
circumstances, would be hazardous in the extreme. The day named can at
least be suspended; perhaps something more favourable may appear. At any
rate, I&nbsp;have too much confidence in your discretion to suppose that
you will, by any rash act, bring reproach either upon yourself or your
connexions.’ Thus spake my father, and immediately withdrew.</p>

<p>“In our present dilemma,” said Theodore, “what is proper to be
done?”</p>

<p>“It is difficult to determine,” answered Alida. “Should my father
expressly forbid our union, or to see each other at present, it is
probable he will carry his commands into effect. I&nbsp;would advise you
to call on him to-morrow with your usual freedom. Whatever may be the
event, I&nbsp;shall deal sincerely with you. Mrs. Raymond has been my
friend and associate from my earliest years&mdash;Raymond you know. In
them we can place the utmost confidence. From them you will be enabled
to obtain information should I be prevented from seeing you. My reliance
on Providence, I&nbsp;trust, will
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page89" id = "page89"
href = "#par_page89">89</a>
never be shaken, but my future prospects, at present, are dark and
gloomy.”</p>

<p>“Let us not despair,” said Theodore; “perhaps those gloomy clouds
which now hover around us, may yet be dissipated by the bright beams of
joy. Worth and innocence are the care of Heaven,&mdash;there rests my
hope. To-morrow, as you propose, I&nbsp;will call at your father’s. If I
should be debarred in future from seeing you, I&nbsp;will write as
formerly, and direct the letters to Raymond.”</p>

<p>Alida now returned home, attended by Theodore. A&nbsp;whip-poor-will
tuned its nightly song at a distance; but the sound which had so late
appeared to them cheerful and sprightly, now passed heavily over their
hearts.</p>

</div>


<p><span class = "firstword">When</span> Theodore returned to the house
of his friend, he unfolded the plan he had projected.</p>

<p>“No sooner,” said Raymond, “was I informed of your misfortunes, than
I was convinced that Alida’s father (whom I have known for many years)
would endeavour to dissolve your intended union with his daughter. And
however he may doat on his children, or value their happiness, he will
not hesitate to sacrifice his better feelings to the accom&shy;plishment
of his wishes to see them independent. It appears that you have but one
resource left. You and Alida are now engaged by the most solemn ties, by
every rite except those which are ceremonial; these I would advise you
to enter into, and trust to the consequences. Mrs. Raymond has proposed
the scheme to Alida, but implicitly accustomed to filial obedience, she
shudders at the idea of a clandestine marriage; but when her father will
proceed to rigorous measures, she will, I&nbsp;think, consent to the
alternative. The world is before
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page91" id = "page91"
href = "#par_page91">91</a>
you, Theodore,” continued he; “you have friends, you have acquirements
which will not fail you. In a country like this you can scarcely help
obtaining a competency, which, with the other requisites you have in
your power, will not fail to insure your independence and felicity.”</p>

<p>“But the times have changed,” said Theodore, since the commencement
of the war, and probably I may yet have to join the army. After I have
made my visit on the morrow to Alida’s father, we will discourse further
on the subject.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Theodore proceeded on the morrow, to make his
intended visit. As he approached the house, he saw Alida sitting in a
shady recess at one end of the garden, near which the road passed. She
was leaning with her head upon her hand in a pensive posture;
a&nbsp;deep dejection was depicted upon her features, which enlivened
into a transient glow as soon as she saw Theodore. She arose, met him,
and invited him into the house.</p>

<p>Theodore was received with a cool reserve by all except Alida. Her
father saluted him with a distant retiring bow, as he passed with her to
the parlour. As soon as they were seated, a&nbsp;lady who had lately
come to reside some time in the family, (who was a relative of her
father’s,) entered the room and seated herself by the window,
alternately humming
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page92" id = "page92"
href = "#par_page92">92</a>
a tune and staring at Theodore, without speaking a word.</p>

<p>This interruption was not of long continuance. Alida’s father
entered, and requested the two ladies to withdraw, which was instantly
done; he then addressed Theodore as follows:</p>

<p>“When I gave consent for your union with my daughter, it was on the
conviction that your future resources would be adequate to support her
honourably and independently. Circumstances have since taken place which
render this point extremely doubtful.” He paused for a reply, but
Theodore was silent. He continued, “You, perhaps, may say that your
acquirements, your prudence, and your industry, will procure you a
handsome income; but to depend on these altogether for your future
exigencies is hazarding peace, honour, and reputation, at a single game
of chance. If, therefore, you have no resources or expectations but such
as these, your own judgment will teach you the necessity of immediately
relinquishing all pretensions to the hand of Alida, and from this time
to break off all communication with my daughter.” He then immediately
left the room.</p>

<p>Why was Theodore speechless through the whole of this discourse? What
reply could he have made? What were the prospects before him but misery
and
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page93" id = "page93"
href = "#par_page93">93</a>
wo? Where, indeed, were the means by which Alida was to be shielded from
indigence, if connected with his fortunes?</p>

<p>The idea was not new, but it came upon him at this time with
redoubled anguish. He arose and looked around for Alida, but she was not
to be seen. He left the house and walked slowly towards Raymond’s. At a
little distance he met Alida who had been strolling in an adjoining
avenue. He informed her of all that had passed; it was no more than they
both expected, yet it was a shock their fortitude could scarcely
sustain. Disappointment seldom finds her votaries prepared to receive
her.</p>

<p>Alida told Theodore that she knew her father’s determinations were
altogether unchangeable at present. Her brother, she said, would be at
home in a few days; how he would act on this occasion, she was unable to
say; but were he ever so far their friend, he would have but feeble
influence with her father. “What is to be the end of these troubles,”
continued she, it is impossible to foresee. Let us trust in the mercy of
Heaven, and submit to its dispensations.</p>

<p>Theodore and Alida, in their happier days, had, when absent from each
other, corresponded. This method it was now thought best to resume. It
was agreed, besides, that Theodore should frequently
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page94" id = "page94"
href = "#par_page94">94</a>
visit Raymond’s, and Alida would resort there also, as she should find
opportunity. Having concluded on this, Alida returned home, and Theodore
to the house of his friend.</p>

<p>The next morning Theodore repaired to the dwelling where his aged
parents now resided. His bosom throbbed with keen anguish when he
arrived there: <ins class = "correction" title = "text unchanged: see parallel version">his own fate unconnected with that of Alida</ins>. His
father was absent when he first reached home, but returned soon after.
A&nbsp;beam of joy gleamed upon his countenance as he entered the house.
“Were it not, Theodore, for your unhappy situation,” said he, “we should
once more be restored to peace and happiness. A&nbsp;few persons who
were indebted to me, finding that I was to be sacrificed by my unfeeling
creditors, reserved those debts in their hands, and have now paid me,
amounting to something more than five thousand pounds. With this I can
live as well and conveniently as I could wish, and can spare some for
your present exigencies, Theodore.”</p>

<p>Theodore thanked his father for his kindness, but told him that from
his former liberality, he had yet sufficient for all his wants. “But
your affair with Alida,” asked his father, “how is that likely to
terminate?” “Favourably, I&nbsp;hope, sir,” answered Theodore.</p>

<a class = "pagenum" name = "page95" id = "page95"
href = "#par_page95">95</a>
<p>He could not consent to disturb the happy tranquil&shy;lity of his
parents by reciting his own wretchedness. He passed a week with them. He
saw them once more comfortably seated at a calm retreat in the country;
he saw them serenely blest in the pleasures of returning peace, and a
ray of joy illumined his troubled bosom.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Again the youth his wonted life regain’d,</p>
<p>A transient sparkle in his eye obtain’d,</p>
<p>A bright, impassion’d, cheering glow express’d</p>

<p>But soon dark gloom the feeble smiles o’erspread;</p>
<p>Like morn’s gay hues, the fading splendours fled;</p>
<p>Returning anguish froze his feeling soul;</p>
<p>Deep sighs burst forth, and tears began to roll!”</p>
</div>


<p>His memory dwelt on Alida, from whom he had heard nothing since he
had last seen her. He thought of the difficulties with which he was
surrounded. He thought of the barriers which were now opposed to their
happiness; and he immediately set out for the house of Raymond. He
arrived at his residence near the close of the day. Raymond and his lady
were at tea, with several young ladies that had passed the afternoon
there. Theodore cast an active glance at the company, in hopes to see
Alida among them, but she was not there. He was invited, and took a seat
at table.</p>

<p>After tea was over, Raymond led Theodore into
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page96" id = "page96"
href = "#par_page96">96</a>
an adjoining room. “You have come in good time,” said he. “Something
speedily must be done, or you lose Alida forever. The day after you were
here, her father received a letter from Bonville, in which, after
mentioning the circumstances of your father’s insolvency, he hinted that
the consequence would probably be a failure of her proposed marriage
with you, which might essentially injure the reputation of a lady of her
standing in life; to prevent which, and to place her beyond the reach of
calumny, he offered to marry her at any appointed day, provided he had
her free consent. As Bonville, by the recent death of his father, had
been put in possession of a splendid fortune, the proposition might
possibly allure the father of Alida, to use his endeavour to bring his
daughter to yield implicit obedience to his wishes. Were he to command
her to live single, it might be endured; but if he should endeavour to
persuade her to discard you from her thoughts entirely, and to give her
hand to a person she could have no esteem for, would be to perjure those
principles of truth and justice, which he himself had ever taught her to
hold most inviolable. To add to Alida’s distress, Bonville arrived there
yesterday, and, I&nbsp;hope in some measure to alleviate it, Albert, her
brother, came this morning. Mrs. Raymond has despatched a message to
inform
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page97" id = "page97"
href = "#par_page97">97</a>
Alida of your arrival, and to desire her to come here immediately. She
will undoubtedly comply with the invitation, if not prevented by
something extraordinary.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond now came to the door of the room, and beckoned to her
husband, who went out, but soon returned, leading in Alida, after which
he retired. “Oh, Theodore,” was all she could say, her further utterance
was interrupted by her tears. Theodore led her to a seat, and overcome
by sadness was unable to speak. Recovering at length, he begged her to
moderate her grief.</p>

<p>“Where,” said he, “is your fortitude, and your firmness, Alida, which
I have so often seen triumphing over affliction?” Her extreme anguish
prevented a reply. Theodore endeavoured to console her, though
consolation was a stranger to his own breast.</p>

<p>“Let us not,” said he, “increase our flood of affliction by a tide of
useless sorrow. Perhaps more prosperous days are yet in reserve for us;
happiness may yet be ours. Heaven cannot desert Alida,” said Theodore;
“as well might it desert its angels. This thorny path may lead to fair
fields of light and verdure. Tempests are succeeded by calms; wars end
in peace; the splendours of the brightest morning arise on the wings of
blackest midnight. Troubles will not always last.”</p>

<a class = "pagenum" name = "page98" id = "page98"
href = "#par_page98">98</a>
<p>The grief which had almost overwhelmed Alida, now began to subside,
as the waves of the ocean gradually cease their tumultuous commotion
after the turbulent winds are laid asleep. Deep and long drawn sighs
succeeded. The irritation of her feelings had caused a more than usual
glow upon her cheek which faded away as she became composed, until a
livid paleness spread itself over her features.</p>

<p>Raymond and his lady now came into the room. They strenuously urged
the propriety and necessity for Theodore and Alida to enter into the
bands of matrimony.</p>

<p>“The measure would be hazardous,” remarked Alida. “My circumstances,”
said Theodore. “Not on that account,” interrupted Alida, “but the
displeasure of my father.”</p>

<p>“Come here, Alida, to-morrow evening,” said Mrs. Raymond. “In the
mean time you will consider the matter and then determine.” To this
Alida assented and prepared to return home.</p>

<p>Theodore attended her as far as the gate which opened into the yard
surrounding the dwelling. It was dangerous for him to go further, lest
he should be discovered even by a domestic of the family. He stood here
awhile looking anxiously after Alida as she walked up the avenue, her
white robes now invisible, now dimly seen, until they were totally
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page99" id = "page99"
href = "#par_page99">99</a>
obscured, mingling with the gloom and darkness of the night, ere she
reached the door of her father’s mansion.</p>

<p>“Thus,” said Theodore, “fades the angel of peace from the visionary
eyes of the war-worn soldier, when it ascends in the dusky clouds of
early morning, while he slumbers on the field of recent battle.” With
mournful forebodings he returned to the house of his friend. After
passing a sleepless night, he arose and walked out into an adjoining
field; he stood for some time, leaning, in deep contemplation, against a
tree, when he heard quick footsteps behind him. He turned around, and
saw Albert approaching. In a moment they were in each other’s arms, and
mingled tears. They soon returned to Raymond’s where they conversed
largely on present affairs.</p>

<p>“I have discoursed with my father on the subject,” said Albert;
“I&nbsp;have urged him with every possible argument, to relinquish his
determination to keep you and Alida separate. I&nbsp;fear, however, he
is inflexible.”</p>

<p>“To endeavour to assuage the grief which rent Alida’s bosom was my
next object, and in this I trust I have not been unsuccessful. You will
see her this evening, and will find her more calm and resigned. You,
Theodore, must exert your fortitude.
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page100" id = "page100"
href = "#par_page100">100</a>
The ways of Heaven are inscrutable, but they are right. We must
acquiesce in its dealings; we cannot alter its decrees. Resignation to
its will, whether merciful or afflictive, is one of those eminent
virtues which adorn the good man’s character, and will ever find a
brilliant reward in the regions of unsullied happiness.”</p>

<p>Albert told Theodore that circumstances compelled him that day to
return to the city. “I&nbsp;would advise you,” said he, <ins class =
"correction" title = "“ missing">“to</ins> remain here until your affair
comes to some final issue. It must, I&nbsp;think, ere long, be
terminated. Perhaps you and my sister may yet be happy<ins class =
"correction" title = "” missing">.”&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>Theodore feelingly expressed his gratitude to Albert. He found in him
that disinterested friendship which his early youth had experienced.
Albert the same day departed for New-York.</p>

<p>The shades of night came on almost insensibly, as Theodore was
anxiously expecting Alida. He anticipated the consolation her presence
would bestow. Albert had told him she was more composed. The evening
passed on, but she came not.</p>

<p>Raymond assured him she would soon be there. He paced the room, and
then walked out on the way whither she was expected to come. He
hesitated some time whether to advance or return. It was possible,
though not probable, that she might
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page101" id = "page101"
href = "#par_page101">101</a>
have come some other way. He hastened back to the house of his friend;
she had not arrived.</p>

<p>“Something extraordinary,” said <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘Mr.’">Mrs.</ins> Raymond, “has undoubtedly prevented her
coming. Perhaps she is ill.” Theodore shuddered at the suggestion. He
looked at his watch: it was past twelve o’clock. Again he hastily
sallied out and took the road to her father’s. The night was exceedingly
dark, being illuminated only by the feeble glimmering of the twinkling
stars. When he came within sight of the house, and as he drew near, no
lights were visible, all was still and silent. He entered the yard,
walked up the avenue, and approached the door. A&nbsp;solemn stillness
prevailed around, interrupted only by the discordance of nightly
insects. The dwelling was shrouded in darkness. In Alida’s room no gleam
of light appeared.</p>

<p>“They are all buried in sleep,” said Theodore, deeply sighing, and I
have only to return in disappointment.</p>

<p>Theodore now withdrew slowly from the place, and repassed the way he
came. As he went back through the garden, he found a person standing at
the foot of it, near the road. After a moment’s scrutiny, he perceived
it to be Bonville.</p>

<p>“What, my chevalier, why are you here?” said he to Theodore. “Hast
thou, then, eluded the
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page102" id = "page102"
href = "#par_page102">102</a>
watchful eyes of Argus, and the vigilance of the dragon?”</p>

<p>“Unfeeling and impertinent intruder!” retorted Theodore, “dost thou
add impudence to thy interference? Go,” said he, “you are unworthy of my
anger. Pursue thy grovelling schemes. Strive to win to your arms a lady
who must ever continue to despise you.”</p>

<p>“Theodore,” replied Bonville, “You and I were rivals in the pursuit
for the hand of Alida. Whether from freak or fortune the preference was
given to you, I&nbsp;know not; and I retired in silence. From
coincidence of circumstances, I&nbsp;think she will now be induced to
give the preference to me, especially after her prospects of connecting
with you are cut off by the events which ruined your fortune. You,
Theodore, have yet, I&nbsp;find, to learn the character of woman. It has
been my particular study. Alida, now ardently impassioned by first
impressions, irritated by recent disappointment, her feelings delicate
and vivid, her affections animated, it would be strange if she could
suddenly relinquish premature attachments founded on such premises. But
remove her from your presence one year, with only distant and uncertain
prospects of seeing you again, admit me as the substitute in your
absence, and she accepts my hand
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page103" id = "page103"
href = "#par_page103">103</a>
as freely as she would now receive yours. I&nbsp;had no design. It never
was my wish to marry her without her free consent;&mdash;that I believe
I shall yet obtain. Under existing circumstances it is impossible but
that you must be separated. Then, when cool deliberation succeeds to the
wild vagaries of fancy, she will discover the dangerous precipice to
which her present inclinations lead. She will prefer indifference and
splendour to love and a cottage. At present I relinquish all further
pursuit; to-morrow I shall return home. When Alida, from calm
deliberation, and the advice of friends, shall freely consent to yield
me her hand, I&nbsp;shall return to receive it. I&nbsp;came from my
lodgings this evening to declare these intentions to her father; but it
being later than I was aware of, the family had gone to rest. I&nbsp;was
about to return, but, looking back again at the house, to see if I could
descry a light, I&nbsp;stood a moment by the garden gate, when you
approached and discovered me.” So saying, he bade Theodore good night,
and walked hastily away.</p>

<p>“I find he knows not the character of Alida,” said Theodore, as he
pursued his way to Raymond’s. When he arrived at the house of his
friend, he related all that had passed between himself and Bonville; and
from what he related, the Raymonds concluded that Alida must be watched
and guarded.</p>

<p>Domestic happiness! of that possessed,</p>
<p>Then may we leave to Providence the rest.</p>
</div>


<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> father of Alida now thought
proper to enter into a second marriage. A&nbsp;lady of worth and
understanding had wrought upon his fancy, and won his particular
regards. Her elegance of manner and dignified deportment engaged general
attention; and although she was rather advanced in life, yet “the
remains of former beauty were still visible in her appearance.”</p>

<p>She was honourably descended from English parents, who had resided in
New-York since the revolution. Her father had been actively engaged in
business there, which had been ultimately crowned with the successful
gifts of fortune.</p>

<p>Her education had been governed by the strictness of the English
discipline. A&nbsp;foundation laid in early piety continued to influence
her mind with unaffected ardour, blended with a generous benevolence,
the genuine effects of the inexhaustible goodness of her heart. She was
one who manifested to the world that a “doer of good” is far preferable
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page105" id = "page105"
href = "#par_page105">105</a>
to any other character, and in a superlative degree above those who
maintain high principles in theory, without ever once reducing them to
practice.</p>

<p>This lady had an only sister, who married a native of Ireland, and
after the course of a few years went to reside there, where she had
recently died. The children returned to this country, having lost their
father long before, and several of her nephews now resided in the city.
Having been always accustomed to reside in town herself, where her many
excellent qualities had endeared her to numerous friends and
acquaintances, who would now feel themselves lost without her society,
therefore the parents of Alida formed the conclusion to pass their
winters in the city, and return to the country in the summer season.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Alida’s father thought the event fortunate, and was
pleased at this time to remove his daughter from the place where the
late scenes appeared so trying and afflictive, with the hope that in
mingling her with the gay world she would in a while forget Theodore,
while he in his turn would be induced to leave the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>It was now at that season when weary summer had lapsed into the
fallow arms of autumn, and was approaching to the chilly breezes of
winter. The morning was clear, and the light gales bore invigorating
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page106" id = "page106"
href = "#par_page106">106</a>
coolness on their wings as they tremulously agitated the foliage of the
western forest, or fluttered among the branches of the trees that
surrounded the mansion. The green splendours of the lawn had faded into
a yellow lustre; the flowery verdure of the fields was changed to a
russet hue.</p>

<p>A robin chirped in a favourite tree in the yard; a&nbsp;wren
chattered beneath, while some few solitary birds still continued to
warble their notes among the leaves of the aspen.</p>

<p>The surrounding groves partially rung with melody; while deep in the
adjacent wilderness the woodpecker, hammering on some dry and blasted
trees, filled the woods with reverberant echoes.</p>

<p>The face of the Sound was ruffled by the lingering breezes, as they
idly wandered over its surface. Long Island was thinly enveloped in
smoky vapour; scattered along its shores lay the numerous small craft,
with larger ships, of the hostile fleet. A&nbsp;few skiffs were passing
and re-passing the Sound. Several American war-sloops lay on a point
which jutted out from the mainland into the river.</p>

<p>Alida walked leisurely around the yard, contemplating the various
beauties of the scene, the images of departed joys (that she was now
about to leave). The days when Theodore participated with her in
admiring the splendours of rural prospect, raised in
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page107" id = "page107"
href = "#par_page107">107</a>
her bosom the sigh of deep regret. She entered the garden, and traced
the walks, now overgrown with weeds and tufted grass. The flower-beds
were choked with the low running brambles, and tall rushes and daisies
had usurped the empire of the kitchen garden. The viny arbour was
principally gone to decay, and the eglantine blushed mournfully along
the fences.</p>

<p>Alida continued to walk the garden until the servant informed her
that the carriage was waiting to take her to the city.</p>

<p>Although they set out rather late in the day, they arrived in town
some hours before sunset. They drove immediately to their dwelling,
which was situated in a pleasant part of Greenwich-street, near the
Battery.</p>

<p>Alida, after she had thrown off her travelling apparel, seated
herself by the window in silence. Her mind was absorbed in deep
reflection and thoughtfulness. She watched the slow declining sun, as it
was sinking beneath the horizon. Pensive twilight spread her misty
mantle over the landscape. The western sky glowed with the spangles of
evening; deepening glooms advanced. The last beam of day faded from the
view, and all was enveloped in night. Innumerable stars glittered in the
firmament, intermingling
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page108" id = "page108"
href = "#par_page108">108</a>
their quivering lustre with the pale splendours of the milky way.</p>

<p>When Alida was summoned to tea, her parents made various observations
to endeavour to amuse her thoughts, and draw her from her taciturnity.
After tea she again returned to the window, where she sat till a late
hour, apparently in deep meditation, till at length growing weary and
restless, she retired to her room.</p>

<p>As she had for several nights in succession slept but little, she
soon fell into a slumber, and did not awake till near the dawn of day.
She did not close her eyes again to sleep. Daylight soon appeared, and
the cheerful sun darting his enlivening rays through the windows of this
antique mansion, recovered her exhausted spirits, and dissipated, in
some measure, the cheerless reflections that still continued to hover
about her imagination.</p>

<p>She arose, and went down to breakfast with spirits somewhat revived,
and changed to a temporary resignation to past events and recent
occurrences. A&nbsp;thought impressed her mind which gave her new
consolation.</p>

<p>“Who knows,” said she, “but that the sun of peace may yet dispel the
glooms of these distressful hours, and restore this throbbing bosom to
its former serenity?”</p>

<a class = "pagenum" name = "page109" id = "page109"
href = "#par_page109">109</a>
<p>In the meantime, Theodore remained in the neighbourhood of Alida
until he heard the family had left and gone to the city. He then
prepared himself to set out early the next day for the habitation of his
parents.</p>

<p>He informed Raymond of his promise to write to Alida, and to transmit
letters through his agency for her inspection every convenient
opportunity.</p>

<p>After passing a weary watchful night, he arose at the first dawning
of day, and proceeded on his journey with a heavy heart and painful
reflections.</p>

<p>After he had passed through the neighbouring village, and gained the
bridge, he looked over and bade the residence of Alida a mournful
farewell. Fearful forebodings crossed his mind that they were separated
forever; then again those more consolatory, that, perhaps, after a long
delay, he and Alida might yet again meet and be happy.</p>

<p>Traits of glory had painted the eastern skies. The glittering
day-star, having unbarred the portals of light, began to transmit its
retrocessive lustre. Thin scuds flew swiftly over the moon’s decrescent
form. Low, hollow winds murmured among the bushes, or brushed the limpid
drops from the intermingling foliage.</p>

<p>The dusky shadows of night fled to the deep glens and rocky caverns
of the wilderness. The
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page110" id = "page110"
href = "#par_page110">110</a>
American lark soared high in the air, consecrating its matin lay to
morn’s approaching splendours.</p>

<p>The woodlands and forest tops on the high hills caught the sun’s
first ray, which, widening and extending, soon gemmed the landscape with
a varying brightness.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon before Theodore arrived at his father’s.
He found his parents contented and happy at their present residence,
which was extremely pleasant, and afforded them many accommodations.</p>

<p>“You have been long gone, my son,” said his father: “I&nbsp;scarcely
knew what had become of you. Since I have become a farmer, I&nbsp;know
little of what is going on in the world, and we were never happier in
our lives. We live as independently as we could desire, and realize the
blessings of health and contentment. Our only disquietude is on your
account, Theodore. Your affair with Alida, I&nbsp;suppose, is not so
favourable as you could wish. But despair not, my son; hope is the
harbinger of fairer prospects; rely on Providence, which never deserts
those who submissively bow to its dispensations. Place entire confidence
and dependence on the Supreme Being,” said his father, “and the triumph
of fortitude and resignation will be yours.” His father paused. His
reasonings, however they convinced the understanding,
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page111" id = "page111"
href = "#par_page111">111</a>
could not heal the wounds of Theodore’s bosom. In Alida he had looked
for as much happiness as earth could afford, nor could he see any
prospect in life which could repair to him her loss.</p>

<p>Unwilling to disturb the serenity of his parents, he did not wish to
acquaint them with the whole affair of his troubles. He answered, that
perhaps all might yet be well; that, however, in the present state of
his mind, he thought a change of place and scene might be of advantage.
He said, moreover, that he no longer had an excuse, and that
circumstances now compelled him to join the army.</p>

<p>A sorrow unknown before seized upon the minds of his parents as
Theodore repeated these words. Sad and dreadful ideas crowded their
imagination at this gloomy period, when in the war’s dread emergency
they must risk the life of an only son, to march to the field of battle.
’Tis true, he might be again restored to them, but were there not a
thousand chances to one? They were overwhelmed with sorrow at these
thoughts, till at length they finally felt themselves obliged to consent
to what they considered his inevitable destiny, leaving the result of
their united wishes and prayers for his safe preservation to an
over-ruling Providence.</p>

<p>His father then offered him money he had on hand to defray his
expenses. Theodore refused,
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page112" id = "page112"
href = "#par_page112">112</a>
saying, his resources had not yet left him. He then disposed of his
horses and carriages, the insignia of his better days, but now useless
appendages.</p>

<p>After taking an affectionate leave of his parents, he set out the
ensuing day to join his companions on their route to meet the army,
which was far distant. When hostilities first commenced, Theodore had
said, that when it became actually necessary, and his father’s affairs
were settled, he would enlist in the service of his country.
Nevertheless, he journeyed with a heavy heart and an enfeebled frame of
spirits, through disappointment, vexation, and fatigue. The scenes he
had so lately experienced moved in melancholy succession over his mind,
and his despondency had not abated, even in a small degree, when he
reached the army.</p>

<p>He now joined the forces under Colonel Van <ins class = "correction"
title = "spelling unchanged">Renssalaer</ins>, “who, with a detachment
of about one thousand men, crossed the river Niagara, and attacked the
British on Queenstown heights. This detachment succeeded in dislodging
the enemy, but not being reinforced by the militia from the American
side, as was expected, they were ultimately repulsed, and obliged to
surrender. Eight hundred British soldiers now came to the aid of the
others, and pressed on to renew the attack. The Americans for a time
continued to struggle against this force,
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page113" id = "page113"
href = "#par_page113">113</a>
but were finally obliged to surrender themselves prisoners of war.”</p>

<p>The fate of war was hard for Theodore, on his first expedition. He
was taken, and carried among the rest on board a prison-ship, and sent
with a number of others to England.</p>

<p>This disastrous event, however, was shortly followed by one more
fortunate for the Americans. “General Dearborn embarked at Sackett’s
Harbour, with sixteen hundred men, on an expedition against York, and
succeeded in the capture of that place.</p>

<p>“York was the seat of government for Upper Canada, and the principal
depot for the Niagara frontier. More naval stores were taken by the
Americans than could be carried away. The government hall was burned,
contrary to the orders of the American general.”</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">Some</span> length of time had elapsed
since the family had been settled in the city, and the cool breezes of
autumn had changed to the hoarse murmuring gales of winter. No sound
scarcely was heard except blustering winds, or their whistling murmurs

cadence of the advancing waves of the Hudson.</p>

<p>The evenings were cold, dark, and gloomy, except when the resplendent
rays of the moon’s mild lustre was seen dispensing its light and
cheering influence, dissipating, in a material degree, the dreariness of
the evenings of this inclement season. Winter had commenced, “sullen and

succeeded each other. Instead of copious showers of rain, snow and ice
were spread over the pavement in heavy masses.</p>

troubled mind.</p>

<p>How great the contrast is now with his former fortunes, how severe
his afflictions! He feels not so much the loss of wealth, but he sighs
for the smiles of former associates and friends. She looked upon her
finger, there was the ring he had given her in happier days. This she
vowed to keep and cherish, through every trial and affliction. It was
Theodore’s last gift. Where was he now? What dangers he may have
encountered, and what hardships endured! and what might he not yet have
to suffer, ere she should behold him again, if indeed she ever
should.</p>

<p>She had not heard from him in a long time. He had promised to
write&mdash;why was he not faithful to his promise?</p>

<p>Thus meditated Alida. At length she articulated in a calmer tone, and
her feelings became more composed.</p>

<p>Alida had lived retired since she had been in town, although in the
midst of gay scenes of every description. The acquaintance she had made
were few. Her second mother had no relatives there, except her sister’s
children, which formed a principal part of her society.</p>

<p>Her oldest nephew was about twenty-five years of age. The personal
appearance of Mr. Bolton was highly prepossessing. He was particularly
distinguished for his genuine politeness, affability, and witticism.</p>

<p>He inherited a considerable patrimony from his grandfather, which
proved to be a disadvantage, as it prevented him from applying himself
to any particular occupation. Since his aunt’s marriage, and his
acquaintance with Alida, his visits had become frequent,
accom&shy;panied with partial attention; though on her part,
indifference was visible, as his earnest
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page117" id = "page117"
href = "#par_page117">117</a>
assiduities, were altogether unexpected, and implied a thing she had not
thought&nbsp;of.</p>

<p>No one had as yet observed his growing fondness and predilection for
Alida, except her father, to whom it was by no means pleasing. The
habitual idleness of this young gentleman, caused him in a great measure
to pass over the consideration of his many excellent qualities.</p>

<p>Among those, with whom Alida had become acquainted during her
residence in the city, was the son of an old friend of her father’s.
This gentleman had place among the merchants in Broadway, and who, by a
long course of industrious trading had amassed a handsome competency.
There was something peculiar in his air and manner, which distinguished
him among the men of business.</p>

<p>Speak of a person of commanding aspect, tall, slender, and majestic;
quick in step, fluent in speech, with large light blue eyes, and light
hair, approaching a little to the yellow. That was Mr. More. <!-- man #4
after Theodore, Bonville and step-cousin Bolton --> There was a neatness
and uniformity in his appearance and dress. He might have been known by
his blue suit, white vest, and cambric handkerchief. He was polite and
agreeable, and by his associates, he was much esteemed as an
acquaintance. His judgment was mature in regard to his business. He
managed his affairs with prudence
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page118" id = "page118"
href = "#par_page118">118</a>
and economy, and still stood firm amid the shock of failures around
him.</p>

<p>Though his means were ample, his expenditures were not extravagant;
every thing about him partook of the convenient and useful. Suitably
free from the fashion <ins class = "correction" title =
"text unchanged">mania which sometimes attack</ins> young people like an
epidemic, he preferred rational pleasures, and the company of a few
young men of liberal views and sentiments, to the empty display and
unsubstantial show, which wins the smile of moneyed plebians.</p>

<p>His general deportment, his countenance and manner, discovered a mind
and disposition, that had always been accustomed to unremitting
indulgence. He was ardent in friendship; possessing a heart of the
keenest sensibility, with a scrupulous regard for the feelings of
others. He had been much in female society&mdash;in company with the
amiable and intelligent. Still he had never seen any one that he thought
was possessed of congenial feelings, or whose mind would assimilate with
his own.</p>

<p>When he became acquainted with Alida, his sensations were awakened to
a new influence;&mdash;that he did not attempt to banish from his mind.
He never before had seen any one he thought so worthy of esteem, or so
calculated to inspire him
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page119" id = "page119"
href = "#par_page119">119</a>
with lasting friendship. “The kindness, and sincerity of her heart,
speaks in her artless manner,” said he, (as he was one evening returning
home from her father’s.) “She delights the old and captivates the young.
Yet her beauty is not so dazzling at first glance, but every day that
she is seen, the more her features charm, the more her manners please.
Innocence dwells in the silvery curls of her light auburn hair, that
waves over her shoulders in simple elegance. She has been reared with
proper care and attention, and educated not to shine in a ball-room, but
with a soft soothing friendship, to dissipate ennui and gloom, and make
the happiness of the domestic circle.”</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">Many</span> were at this time risking their
lives in defence of American liberty, and privileges;&mdash;nor were
there at present any prospects of conciliatory measures between the
contending powers. It became necessary for the people in the meantime,
to call forth all their energies and patriotism, with the utmost
exertion on their parts&mdash;in support of their country, in order to
maintain the burden of the arduous conflict in which it was engaged, and
sustain the present contest with honour to themselves, and with the hope
that its final settlement might be to the satisfaction of America, and
the future prosperity of the nation.</p>

<p>Many heroes ventured forth to the field of battle, with the ardent
endeavour, still to preserve their independence; while at the same time
the hearts of many were failing them with fear. It was a time for the
patriot to use his influence to animate others anew to bravery, and
persuade them to be zealous, in a just cause; at this season of general
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page121" id = "page121"
href = "#par_page121">121</a>
excitement, in which the feelings of the whole community had become
strongly interested. Party spirit, and the conflicting interests of the
different states were found to operate injuriously on many in their
commercial transactions. The people were impoverished by the expenses of
the war. Some were in debt. Creditors resorted to legal measures to
enforce a collection of their demands, which involved many families in
deep embarrassment. Peace was sighed for by the multitude, but there
were yet no signs of its realization. An engagement had just taken place
on Lake Erie. The American fleet was commanded by Commodore Perry,
a&nbsp;young officer; that of the British under Com. Barclay, an old and
experienced officer, who had served under Nelson. After a contest of
three hours the Americans gained a complete victory, and captured every
vessel of the enemy. Commodore Perry announced this victory in the
following laconic style: “We have met the enemy, and they are ours.” The
Americans took six hundred prisoners, which exceeded their whole number
engaged in the action. This battle was succeeded, several weeks
afterwards, by another that was alike fortunate, between the American
army under General Harrison, and the British under Gen. Proctor, in
which they were defeated,
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page122" id = "page122"
href = "#par_page122">122</a>
and Detroit fell into the hands of the Americans. The success of this
action may be entirely attributed, (under the favour of heaven,) to the
abilities and military skill of General Harrison.</p>

<p>After General Hull had tamely surrendered to the British this
important post, with the gallant force that composed the garrison, an
event which spread consternation far and wide throughout the western
country, and greatly increased the difficulty and arduous nature of Gen.
Harrison’s duties, he immediately organized the brave troops under his
command, and commenced a course of rigid discipline, and military <ins
class = "correction" title = "plural in original">trainings</ins>, with
the confident hope of retrieving the consequent disasters of this
proceeding.</p>

<p>The American army advanced in order of battle, and were in the
immediate neighbourhood of the enemy; the reconnoitering parties brought
in intelligence of the dispositions Proctor had made, wherein he had
committed an irretrievable error in ranging his regular soldiers in
order, and extending his line by placing the files at a distance of
three or four feet from each other. Harrison, with the rapid decision of
an able general, instantly availed himself of the error of his opponent.
The extended and weakened line of the enemy, could offer but a feeble
resistance to the charge of his gallant
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page123" id = "page123"
href = "#par_page123">123</a>
troops, who dashed forward at the earnest solicitation of the people of
the territory,&mdash;and with the public expression of the most
flattering approbation, on the part of the chief executive;&mdash;till
at length they gained a complete victory.</p>

<p>The various and arduous duties of the governor of Indiana, required,
for this office, a&nbsp;man of very superior abilities&mdash;one
possessed of stern integrity and prudent moderation, accom&shy;panied by
the most unwavering firmness. Such a man Governor Harrison, in the long
course of his administration, fully proved himself to be. And in acting
his part as a general he merits no less the applauses of his countrymen,
in training and leading their armies to victory. The nervous and
impassioned eloquence, and classical felicity of illustration, with
which he enforced his arguments, gained him much applause and
influence,&mdash;and discovered his abilities to be of the highest
order, blended with the truest republican principles;&mdash;in which
were manifested an ardent zeal for the good of his country, and an
earnest desire to serve her best interests. Though vested with unusual
powers, both as governor and general, he was never known during the
whole of his command, to exercise his authority in an unjust or
oppressive manner. His measures were energetic but always qualified by
his characteristic
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page124" id = "page124"
href = "#par_page124">124</a>
moderation and humanity, joined with integrity, prudence, and capacity
for civil government. Many high encomiums were lavished upon him by
those whose friends and neighbours had participated in this campaign,
and who were consequently familiar with its details, and with the merits
of their commander.</p>

<p>And Detroit is destined to be remembered, as the place of the battle
ground of one of the most remarkable and decisive actions that took
place during the late war.</p>

<p>Shortly after this action was over, Bonville, who was one among the
soldiers, returned to New-York. He furnished plausible reason, and
obtained a furlough from his commanding officer, for leave of absence.
In the meantime, he thought again to visit Alida; he had at present a
double motive again to address her,&mdash;and if he should prove
successful, her expected fortune would make him ample amends for what he
had squandered away in scenes of folly. And if the father of Theodore
had become a bankrupt by misfortune, he had now almost become one by
dissipation and extravagance.</p>

<p>Albert had been extremely busy through the day, and was just
returning home from his store in Pearl-street one evening, when he met
Bonville in Broadway on his way to his father’s. He accosted
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page125" id = "page125"
href = "#par_page125">125</a>
him in a very friendly manner, and then interrogated him by numerous
questions concerning the family,&mdash;and very inquisitively with
regard to his sister. Albert made no reply that gave him any particular
satisfaction. When they arrived at the house, they found no company
except Mr. More. Alida was truly shocked and surprised at this
unexpected visit from Bonville, who she had no idea was in town. After
making to her his compliments, and expressing his pleasure at finding
her well, he by degrees drew her into a conversation which lasted the
greater part of the evening. He offered an ill-timed consolation for the
absence of Theodore, and affected much regret,&mdash;although he said
his case was not as deplorable as that of many others, as he was still
among the living. That though he was a person he could not esteem, still
he had felt so far interested in his welfare, as to make particular
inquiries how the British were accustomed to treat their prisoners. He
then gave some dark intimations against his general character, which
could not fail to throw over the mind of Alida a deep dejection.</p>

<p>She was now apprised of the fate of Theodore:&mdash;She was unable to
suppress the feelings of sorrow, that these words of Bonville had
excited. She remained silent; wholly engrossed by the confused thoughts
and sad ideas, that arose in succession in
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page126" id = "page126"
href = "#par_page126">126</a>
her mind, till at length she became regardless of all around her.</p>

<p>The penetrating eyes of Mr. More were fixed upon her during this
conversation. He seemed wholly insensible to every other object. He was
apprehensive that her heart was insensible to the strong affection that
pervaded his own,&mdash;and he thought should she prove incapable of
loving like himself, and should become devoted to another, thoughts he
could scarcely endure,&mdash;though they sometimes impressed the idea
that she might never be interested in his favour. Hope would again
flatter him with the pleasing thought, that her bosom may have been
fraught with congenial feelings, and her heart beat with sensations even
more fervent than his own. Her image filled his waking thoughts, and
disturbed with visionary happiness his sleeping hours,&mdash;yet it
seemed to his devoted mind the love of merit alone; and he imagined that
while she was happy, he could never be altogether otherwise.</p>

<p>After Mr. More and Bonville had taken leave, and her parents had
retired to rest, Alida remained by the fire-side till a late hour. She
was meditating on recent circumstances, on the many late trying events
which had crowded so rapidly that they could scarcely be said to succeed
each other, and which had given so great variety to her life, that for
years had
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page127" id = "page127"
href = "#par_page127">127</a>
rolled on in the same peaceful, unvaried course. She felt displeased at
Bonville for his insinuations concerning Theodore, which were ungenerous
and ill-natured,&mdash;while he seemed to flatter himself with the idea
that she would become forgetful of him. He had hitherto yielded to every
selfish propensity, without once seriously reflecting on its
consequences to himself or others. His understanding, warped by
prejudice, and without control, often misled him, and the superiority an
elevated station gave him caused him to neglect to practice those better
principles of which his nature might have been capable. His pride would
suffer to see Alida united to another, therefore he was determined not
to relinquish her. He concluded that finally she would look upon
Theodore with indifference, and become favourably disposed towards
himself; while his regard for her should prove unchangeable. That,
unacquainted as she was with the world, she would at length be brought
to accede to his wishes. That his rhetoric operating on her inexperience
would ultimately influence her in his favour.</p>

abroad their cheering influences, and the mild and salubrious breezes of
spring had succeeded <ins class = "correction" title = "text unchanged: may be an error">to</ins> the blustering gales of winter. The parents of
Alida made preparation to return to the country. Alida’s father was
declining in health. He had imparted to his son his wish for him to
close and settle his mercantile affairs in the city, (as the times were
dreary,) and return to the paternal estate. In the meantime, Albert’s
assistance was necessary to alleviate his father, as he was now advanced
in years, and had principally relinquished all public business, except
attending to its calls only when requested in cases of emergency.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolton had been with the family several days, and attended them
on board the steamboat. One would scarcely suppose that so interesting
an
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page129" id = "page129"
href = "#par_page129">129</a>
exterior as his, blended with highly polished manners, should not have
made some impression on the mind of Alida if her heart had been
disengaged. Besides, he was a person too amiable not to be esteemed. His
ideas with regard to Alida were altogether sanguine. He believed, as
soon as he should ask the consent of her parents, he would easily obtain
his wishes. He considered his own fortune already sufficient, without
seeking more in the din of business. And he possessed many other
advantages which pleaded in his favour. With these hopes of assured
success, he made proposals to her father. The manner in which her father
replied to him was altogether discouraging, which excluded the hope of
his ever gaining the hand of his daughter by his consent. This denial
was a sensible cause of chagrin to Mr. Bolton, but yet it did not
discourage him.</p>

<p>The impatience sometimes of obtaining a thing which is refused to us,
renders it still more desirable, and the heart is never in a greater
flutter than when it is agitated with the fear of losing the object it
most wishes to gain. Moreover, he believed that Alida was already
interested in his favour, and he determined to suggest to her, the first
opportunity, the plan to elope with him, and thus put it out of the
power of her father to impede their happiness.</p>

<a class = "pagenum" name = "page130" id = "page130"
href = "#par_page130">130</a>
<p><ins class = "correction" title = "paragraph break added by transcriber">The day</ins> was calm and serene, and the air
invigorating. The steam-boat floated slowly upon the waters in
monotonous movement. There was music on board. A&nbsp;company of militia
were going to the village of &mdash;&mdash;, where they usually paraded
the town for several hours, took dinner at the hotel, and then returned
again to the city.</p>

<p>Alida remained on deck nearly the whole way, to be a spectator of the
various, beautiful landscapes that presented themselves on the river,
particularly at this season of the year. A&nbsp;gentle breeze sprung up
as they passed the little islands at the entrance of the bay, on whose
glassy surface the sun shone with meridian splendour, illustrating the
peculiar beauty of the diversified scenery. In the course of a few hours
they arrived at the village of &mdash;&mdash;, where they obtained a
conveyance to take them on to their family residence, where they arrived
some time in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Although all nature was smiling around, and the variegated landscape
never appeared more enchanting, birds of every description were seen
chirping on the spray, and the trees resounded with their sportive
melody, and Alida might still have been happy if she had never become
acquainted with Theodore; yet while she had the appearance of serenity,
she still cherished a secret uneasiness.
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page131" id = "page131"
href = "#par_page131">131</a>
She had never received any intelligence concerning him since they had
last parted. She imagined herself altogether forgotten, as Bonville had
frequently suggested. Besides, he had represented Theodore as worthless.
Harrassed and oppressed by a thousand different conjectures, she could
scarcely support herself under them with any degree of resignation.</p>

<p>In this frame of mind, in serious meditation, she took a seat by the
window. The sun was declining slowly beneath the horizon to gladden
other regions. The spire of the village church was tipped with gold, and
the resplendent rays reflected from the window dazzled the eye. Above
was the azure vault variegated with fleecy clouds; beneath was nature’s
verdant carpet. The little songsters of the adjoining grove were paying
their tribute of praise in melodious strains. The bleating of the lambs,
and the lowing of the milky train, re-echoed from the fields and
valleys; while the gentle murmuring of the water-fall at the mill, with
its rumbling cadence over the dam, was heard at a little distance. “How
still is nature,” said Alida. “The sun has withdrawn his radiance, yet
the gleam from yonder western sky bespeaks him still at hand, promising
to return with his reviving warmth when nature is refreshed with
darkness. The bay is already beginning
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page132" id = "page132"
href = "#par_page132">132</a>
to be silvered over by the mild rays of the queen of night. Gently she
steals on the world, while she bestows on us her borrowed splendour. She
lights the wandering traveller, she warms the earth with gentle heat.
She dazzles not the eye of the philosopher, but invites him to
contemplate and admire. Scarcely a breeze is stirring; the shadow of
each tree remains undisturbed; the unruffled bay and river glide
smoothly on, reflecting nature’s face. Again the attention is drawn, and
the eye wanders to yon vast concave, where the mind follows in silent
wonder, wandering among the planets, till, struck with beauty of the
whole, it acknowledges ‘the Hand that made it is divine.’</p>

<p>“Surely,” said Alida, “all nature conspires to calm the mind, to
restore tranquil&shy;lity, to soften every care and corroding thought.
But what can ease the troubled mind, which, like the angry sea, after
agitation by blustering winds, ’tis still tumultuous?” Where now,
thought she, is Theodore? What sadness and difficulty may not his noble
and generous spirit have had to encounter! His tender sensibility, his
serene and pacific disposition, may have had numerous trials; and how
unhappy he may be, who was ever ardent in his endeavours to communicate
peace and happiness to others! When she reflected upon all his goodness,
his zealous piety, his religious
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page133" id = "page133"
href = "#par_page133">133</a>
sentiments the same as her own, and recalled to her memory happier days,
when she had listened with pleasure to the powerful eloquence of a
corresponding spirit. And her esteem for him rose higher, while he
commented on religious truths, and bade her place a firm dependence on
Divine Providence. Amid these uneasy sensations, which filled the bosom
of Alida with anxiety and grief, and left her mind in a state of
despondency, the period arrived for the celebration of her father’s
birth-day, which brought with it, as usual, much company from the city,
from the neighbouring village, with the parish minister and his
family.</p>

<p>After her several sisters had arrived, and nearly all the company had
collected, Alida entered the drawing-room with spirits somewhat
re-animated. Bonville was already there. He arose and handed her to a
seat. He accom&shy;panied the first salutations with many flattering
compliments, but with all his endeavours to win her favour, he could not
awaken even a temporary regard in the bosom of Alida. In the meantime,
she had full leisure to observe his singular behaviour, to listen to his
insinuating address, to hear him mention the name of Theodore, and when
he observed her feelings were excited, to hear him suddenly change the
subject. He sometimes appeared to regard her with an eye of pity,
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page134" id = "page134"
href = "#par_page134">134</a>
but it arose from a consciousness of his own errors, bordering on
baseness. He felt unhappy at his own want of integrity, and his heart
reproached him with injustice and treachery.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">In</span> a series of events, a&nbsp;period
at length arrived, which manifested to mankind, in a more melancholy
degree, the shocking consequences and devastation of war, the
overwhelming sorrow that is brought on families for the loss of friends,
with the discouraging embarrassments attending all kinds of
business.</p>

<p>A severe engagement had recently taken place within half a mile of
the Niagara cataract. General Scott, on his arrival at Niagara Falls,
learned that the British were in force directly in his front, separated
only by a narrow piece of wood. He soon pressed through the wood, and
engaged the British on the Queenstown road. He advanced upon the enemy,
and the action commenced at six o’clock in the afternoon, and continued
with little intermission until twelve at night. The thunder of the
cannon, the roaring of the falls, the incessant discharge of artillery
during the six hours in which the parties were in combat, heightened by
the circumstance of its being night, afforded such a scene as is rarely
to
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page136" id = "page136"
href = "#par_page136">136</a>
be met with in the history of the wars of nations. The evening was calm,
and the moon shone with lustre when not enveloped in clouds of smoke
from the firing of the contending armies. Taking into consideration the
numbers engaged, few contests have ever been more sanguinary. The battle
was one of the most severe that had been fought during the war. The
British troops engaged in this action amounted to 5000 men; many of them
were selected from the flower of Lord Wellington’s army. Colonel
Miller’s achievement, in storming the battery, was of the most brilliant
and hazardous nature, and entitled him to the highest applause among the
Americans.</p>

<p>The measures of the president relative to the war were of such a
nature as greatly to draw upon him the approbation and gratitude of the
nation. He early began to turn his mind to a contemplation of the
general politics of his country. He, therefore, became advanced in the
requisite qualifications to assume and maintain the important station he
held over it. He had imbibed an attachment for civil liberty almost from
his infancy, which influenced his every action. He was of a pacific
temperament, and pursued those measures as long as they would answer.
But when it became actually necessary for him to recommend to congress
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page137" id = "page137"
href = "#par_page137">137</a>
to pursue a different course, it was then that the benefactor of his
country endeavoured to concert measures still to preserve America as an
asylum for civil and religious liberty. He possessed qualities well
calculated to fulfil the duties of his high station with honour to
himself and justice to the community. He was dignified in his
deportment, kind, generous, and condescending; a&nbsp;patron to science;
a&nbsp;uniform promoter of honourable enterprise, but an enemy to every
thing dishonest, hypocritical, and disingenuous. And, as a Christian, he
firmly adhered to the gospel, and regulated his life by its precepts and
injunctions, in a consistent and exemplary manner. This illustrious
president had the good fortune to be blessed with a consort whose
qualifications in her particular capacity were no less adequate to fill
with dignity her elevated station. The parents of Mrs. Madison were
natives of Virginia. Their daughter was educated in Philadelphia among
the Friends. She was, therefore, little indebted to acquired graces and
accom&shy;plishments for the admiration and regard which followed her
wherever she was known. To much personal beauty she added a warm heart
and a benevolent disposition&mdash;charms and attractions which won for
her not only admirers but friends, and exalted her to high eminence
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page138" id = "page138"
href = "#par_page138">138</a>
in the public estimation. Her natural <ins class = "correction" title =
"‘and’ missing: see parallel version">and</ins> acquired endowments she
carried into society with such pleasing manners and graceful demeanour,
as produced almost universally an impression highly favourable to
herself among the citizens of Washington. Her society was much esteemed
in all the companies she frequented. Her mental powers were of a
superior grade, and the effects of genuine piety and Christian
benevolence distinguished all her actions. To these she added an
amiability of temper, the polished address of a lady, with a
conversation both pleasing and instructive. Her deportment to all was
prepossessing, by the affectionate manner in which she addressed them
separately, and the interest she manifested in their welfare. In these
she showed no difference between the rich and the poor, and devoted much
of her time to the cause of charity. She was eminently distinguished for
her amiable qualities, and a peculiar versatility of talent in her
conversation and manners. She entertained the numerous friends and
guests of the president with cordial hospitality. She treated her
husband’s relatives with regard and kindness; and in the president’s
house, whenever there were female guests, Mrs. Madison always
presided.</p>

<p>After the president’s, the house of the secretary
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page139" id = "page139"
href = "#par_page139">139</a>
of state was the resort of most company. The frank and cordial manners
of its mistress gave a peculiar charm to the frequent parties there
assembled. All foreigners who visited the seat of government, strangers
from the different states of the Union, the heads of departments, the
diplomatic corps, senators, representatives, and citizens, mingled with
an ease and freedom, a&nbsp;sociability and gaiety to be met with in no
other society. Even party spirit, virulent and embittered as it then
was, by her gentleness, was disarmed of its asperity.</p>

<p>Individuals who never visited the president’s dwelling, nor met at
the other ministerial houses, could not resist the softening influences
of her conciliatory disposition, with her frank and generous manners.
She was constantly receiving and reciprocating civilities in the most
kind and friendly manner with the inhabitants of Washington. The
president, being wholly absorbed in public business, left to Mrs.
Madison the discharge of the duties of social intercourse. And never was
woman better calculated for the task. Exposed as she necessarily was, in
so conspicuous a situation, to envy, jealousy, and misconstruction, she
so managed as to conciliate the good-will of all, without offending the
self-love of any of the numerous competitors for her favour and
attention. Every visiter left her
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page140" id = "page140"
href = "#par_page140">140</a>
with the pleasing impression of being an especial favourite, of having
been the object of peculiar attention. She never forgot a name she had
once heard, nor a face she had once seen, nor the personal circumstances
connected with every individual of her acquaintance. Her quick
recognition of persons, her recurrence to their peculiar interests
produced the gratifying impression in each and all of those who
conversed with her that they were especial objects of regard. The house
was very plainly furnished, and her dress in no way extravagant; and it
was only in hospitality and charity that her profusion was unlimited.
The amiable and engaging qualities which have been here described,
characterized Mrs. Madison in her husband’s public life. In the midst of
the bitterness of party spirit, and the violence of political animosity,
she was mild and courteous to all. The political assailants of her
husband she treated with a kindness which disarmed their hostility of
its individual rancour, and sometimes even converted political enemies
into personal friends, and still oftener succeeded in neutralizing the
bitterness of opposition.</p>

<p>At this period her courage and firmness were put to a severe test. In
August, 1814, the British troops landed forty miles below Washington,
and
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page141" id = "page141"
href = "#par_page141">141</a>
approached that city. The president left the city to hold a council of
war. Before his departure he anxiously inquired if she had courage or
firmness to remain in their house until his return on the morrow, or
succeeding day. She assured him she had no fear but for him and the
success of the army. When the president reached Bladensburgh he
unexpectedly found the two armies engaged. Meanwhile terror spread over
the city&mdash;all who could obtain conveyances fled to the adjoining
towns. The sound of the cannon was distinctly heard, and universal
confusion and dismay prevailed. Some personal friends who remained with
Mrs. Madison, strongly urged her to leave the city. They had her
carriage brought to the door, but could not persuade her to enter it
till her husband should return, and accom&shy;pany her. And she did not
finally depart till several messengers had been despatched to bid her
fly. Much as she graced her public station, she was not less admirable
in domestic life. Neighbourly and <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘companiable’">companionable</ins> among her country
friends, as if she had never lived in a city, delighting in the society
of the young, and never better pleased than when promoting every
youthful pleasure by her participation;&mdash;she still proved herself
the affectionate consort, without neglecting the duties of a kind
hostess, and a faithful
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page142" id = "page142"
href = "#par_page142">142</a>
friend and relation. She smoothed and enlivened, occupied and appeased,
each varying scene of life. Her husband knew, appreciated, and
acknowledged the blessing which heaven had bestowed on him, in giving
him such a companion.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">All</span> business of importance, at this
time, was in a manner suspended in New-York; the face of things wore a
dismal aspect, and the greater part of the community were in dismay;
occasioned by the continuance of hostilities with Great Britain. All
appeared in a declining state, discouraging to the industry and best
prospects of the inhabitants;&mdash;and although there had been some
rumours of peace, it was not yet concluded.</p>

<p>A severe battle had lately taken place at New-Orleans, in which the
Americans were victorious. Another was fought some little time
afterwards on Lake Champlain. The British fleet, with 1050 men
approached Plattsburgh, while the American fleet were lying off that
place. The British fleet bore down upon them in order of battle,
commanded by <ins class = "correction" title = "capitalization unchanged">sir</ins> George Prevost, Governor General of Canada.
Commodore Macdonough, the American commander, ordered his vessels to be
cleared for action, and gallantly received the enemy. The
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page144" id = "page144"
href = "#par_page144">144</a>
engagement was exceedingly obstinate. After a contest of two hours, the
British ships and several sloops of war fell into the hands of the
Americans. Before sunset the temporary batteries of the enemy were all
silenced, and every attempt to cross from Plattsburgh to the American
works was repelled. At nine o’clock the object was abandoned, and the
British general hastily drew off his forces. Large quantities of
military stores were left behind, and fell into the hands of the
Americans.</p>

<p>The people of the United States were at this time divided into two
political parties; one party condemned the war as unwise and
unnecessary; the other contending that the war was just, and necessary,
for the maintenance of national honour. The opposition to the war was
the greatest in the New England states, and during its continuance this
opposition was confirmed. Enlistments of troops were in some instances
discouraged, and dissentions arose between the general and state
governments, respecting the command of the militia, called out by order
of the former, to defend the sea-board. Accordingly the legislature of
Massachusetts appointed delegates to meet and confer with the delegates
from the states of New England, or any of them, upon the subject of
their public grievances and concerns. The delegates
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page145" id = "page145"
href = "#par_page145">145</a>
met at Hartford, Connecticut, in 1815, and sat nearly three weeks with
closed doors. This convention consisted of delegates from the state of
Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island; two members from New
Hampshire, and one from Vermont. After their adjournment, the convention
published an address, charging the nation with pursuing measures hostile
to the interest of New England, and recommended amendments to the
Federal Constitution. The report of the Hartford Convention concluded
with the resolution providing for the calling of another convention,
should the United States refuse their consent to some arrangements<ins
class = "correction" title = "punctuation unchanged">,&mdash;</ins>whereby the New England States, separately, or
in concert, might be empowered to assume upon themselves the defence of
their territory against the enemy. The committee appointed to
communicate these resolutions to Congress, met at Washington the news of
peace: and owing to this event, another Convention was not called. And
may it never be the fate of America, to be again involved in hostilities
with her mother country, from whence is derived her revered
religion;&mdash;each nation possessing towards the other reciprocal
fellow-feelings, becoming Christian brethren.</p>

Transparencies, emblematical of the liberties of the country, were

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> patriotic feelings of Alida’s
father partook in the general joy and satisfaction of the community, and
he soon turned his attention to celebrate the event of the late peace
with tokens of rejoicing. Numerous were the company that collected at
his house on the day set apart for this purpose. The dwelling was
illuminated, and the guests assembled at an early hour in the evening on
this joyful occasion.</p>

<p>Unaffected pleasure enlivened the scene, and presided throughout the
assembly; light-hearted wit broke forth in a thousand brilliant sallies,
while unfeigned joy heightened the flush on the cheek of youth, and
smoothed the furrows on the brow of age. Nor did the sprightly fair
ones, with the gay young gentlemen, fail to exert themselves to enhance
the present felicity of the company. The gaiety of the scene, the flow
of general joy, the sight of so many happy people, the countenances of
the happy parents in witnessing the innocent
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page152" id = "page152"
href = "#par_page152">152</a>
mirth of their children, with the benevolent looks of the noble bestower
of the entertainment, formed altogether a scene which failed not to fill
the heart with sensations the most pleasing and satisfactory.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolton was occupied in attending the ladies generally, while a
genuine witticism occasionally mingling with his discourse, gave one no
mean opinion of his understanding, and increased their admiration of his
talents. He was well calculated to please; there was something
remarkably graceful in his exterior, and he exerted himself this evening
particularly to assist Alida to entertain the numerous visiters.</p>

<p>Bonville endeavoured in various ways to attract attention. He was
extremely humorous and gay, and the whole party was enlivened by his
vivacity. He described the folly of some of the prevailing fashions of
the town with sarcastic pleasantry, and related many anecdotes of the
gay world and fashionable life, interesting to those who had lived in
retirement. Alida could not but listen with some degree of pleasure to
his amusing conversation, and the pleasing allusions he frequently made
gradually drew the attention of the whole company.</p>

<p>Albert selected from the rest an interesting young lady, to whom he
directed the most of his
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page153" id = "page153"
href = "#par_page153">153</a>
attention, while she, pleased with his politeness, exerted all her
conversational powers to entertain him. His father was much pleased to
see his son endeavour to make himself agreeable in ladies’ society; he
thought it augured a good sign, and would be conducive to meliorate and
refine his manners. He had long wished him to close his affairs of
business in the city, and settle himself on the paternal estate. He was
anxious that he should seek out an amiable companion, of pious
principles and exemplary manners, of genuine goodness and benevolence,
in whose deportment was mingled the rays of mildness, amiability, and
cheerfulness; well-meaning towards all, blended with an unaffected ease
and politeness, joined with the usual accom&shy;plishments to complete
the character of a lady.</p>

<p>An unusual degree of innocent amusement prevailed throughout the
circle on this evening of general joy, and all were more or less
enlivened and cheered by its salutary effects, except Mr. More, who, in
the midst of music and mirth, remained sad and melancholy; despondent
reflections at times deeply disturbed his tranquil&shy;lity. In the
midst of these scenes of festivity, he was serious and thoughtful;
gloomy ideas would in spite of himself cloud his imagination, whenever
his thoughts
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page154" id = "page154"
href = "#par_page154">154</a>
foreboded the fear of losing the only object of his affection.</p>

<p>The elderly gentlemen had a long consolatory conversation on the
present affairs of the country, and their happy termination; the wisdom
of the government and its coinciding regulations, concluding that the
late peace, founded on principles of justice and honour, promised to be
lasting.</p>

<p>These festive scenes of gladness were concluded by a variety of
music, both vocal and instrumental; the powerful influence of which all
must acknowledge; which is alike visible in all places, and in every
stage of society. And while it flings its spell over the gay abodes of
pleasure, it produces likewise its sweet enchantment in the domestic
dwelling. The ladies alternately played the piano, while the gentlemen
assisted in singing, forming altogether a concert of melodious harmony
that wakened the mind to the softest raptures, and threw its bewitching
influences over the imagination, calming all former corroding
sensations, and animating anew all the soft and sympathetic
emotions.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">Several</span> weeks now passed away
without any material occurrence, and the season of the year came round
when the winter’s snow was passing from the face of nature, succeeded by
heavy showers of rain, and the days had become more pleasant, because
they were something longer. The air was more salubrious, and invited the
citizens to inhale its healthful draught without their dwellings, where
they had been several months in a manner shut up from the inclemencies
of the cold season.</p>

<p>One morning after the family had taken breakfast, they sat talking
over late events and recent occurrences that had varied so materially
within the last three months. In this conversation, they were unmindful
of the hour, until Mr. Bolton, without ceremony, (as was his custom,)
entered the breakfast parlour. After the usual salutations to her
parents, and conversing some time with his aunt, he addressed Alida with
his native pleasantry,
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page157" id = "page157"
href = "#par_page157">157</a>
relating to her some stories of the satirical order as the current news
of the city. He afterwards informed her of the conversation between
himself and her father, and in what manner the latter had replied. Alida
remained silent, with her eyes fixed upon the floor, as if revolving in
her mind what to say. In the meantime, he did not await her reply, but
entreated her in the most pathetic language to consent to elope with
him, and at all events to unite her destiny with his; at the same time
telling her that implicit obedience to a parent’s will, in an affair
that so materially concerned her happiness, could not be expected, and
that her father was much to blame in attempting to control her liberty
of choice; saying, moreover, that after their views should be
accomplished, that he had no doubt whatever of his reconciliation. He
had lately received intelligence of the death of an uncle in Savannah,
who had bequeathed to him his fortune. He was preparing for his
departure <ins class = "correction" title = "text unchanged: error for ‘thither’?">thence</ins>. He would not, therefore, give up his former
project, and thought to avail himself of this opportunity, (by all the
rhetoric he was master of,) to urge Alida to accept him and
accom&shy;pany him on his journey. He even proposed whither they should
escape from the eye of her father for the performance of the marriage
ceremony.</p>

<a class = "pagenum" name = "page158" id = "page158"
href = "#par_page158">158</a>
<p>Alida was truly shocked and surprised at a proposition so unexpected
from Mr. Bolton, after he had known her father’s decision. She had never
considered him in any other light than as a brother; and being a
connexion in the family, they had always been on terms of friendly
intercourse. She, therefore, would have avoided this meeting if she
could have had previously an idea of the result.</p>

<p>After he had made to her these several propositions, her displeasure
held her for some time silent, while it affected her mind sensibly.
Never&shy;theless, she endeavoured to recover herself to answer him in a
decided, and, at the same time, in a manner compatible with her present
feelings. She commenced urging him to endeavour to forget her in any
other light than as a friend. “Can you suppose, Mr. Bolton,” said she,
“that I would set a parent’s will at defiance, by committing so unwary
an action as to dispose of myself in a clandestine manner, nor could you
again imagine that I would give my hand where my heart has no particular
regard.” She scarcely uttered this, and could say no more ere he
conjured her not to shut her heart against him for ever, and entreated
her to permit him still to hope that after a while her compassion might
become awakened to the remembrance
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page159" id = "page159"
href = "#par_page159">159</a>
of a sincere, true, and constant heart, which would cause her to heave
the sympathetic sigh for one who could never eradicate her from his
memory, even for a moment, or chase from his bosom the esteem and love
that time could neither weaken nor extinguish. He was extremely
sorrowful in taking leave of Alida and the family, and set out the
ensuing day on his journey.</p>

<p>Alida felt unhappy at the earnest importunities of a person she could
not but have some esteem for. She could not fail to admire the superior
powers of his mind. In his conversation, he was all that was agreeable,
entertaining, and improving, which abounded with sallies of wit and
humour, joined to a fund of erudition acquired by a collegiate
education. He was particular to associate only with young men of merit,
talents, and genius. He possessed a native vein of satire, which he
sometimes indulged with much effect; though, however, he had this
dangerous weapon under such thorough discipline, that he rarely made use
of it in a way which gave offence to any. He never accumulated any
wealth by his own exertion, as he thought what he already inherited was
more than sufficient for all his wants. He seemed not to seek for an
abundance, like many others, as necessary to his happiness, thinking
that, with contentment, the peasant
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page160" id = "page160"
href = "#par_page160">160</a>
is greater than the prince destitute of this benign blessing, and that a
competency, rather than a superfluity, could convey real happiness to
man. He thought, that to the improper pursuit after happiness could be
attributed much of the misery of mankind; daily he saw dread examples of
this serious truth, that many, in grasping at the shadow, had lost the
substance. A&nbsp;near relative had now been bountiful to leave him a
fortune. That, however, he was thankful for, as it increased his fund
for charitable purposes. His intention was to get possession of this and
return to the city of New-York, to make it his permanent residence.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> genial warmth of the air had now
animated anew the magnificence of nature’s works, and the verdant
scenery of spring decked the landscape with all its resplendent
colouring and variety. As the season advanced, all classes of people had
recourse to their favourite walk on the Battery, either for pleasure, or
as an alleviation from the toils and cares of business. This healthy
promenade drew together a number of the citizens in the morning, but
many more resorted there in the evening, and a numerous throng here
regaled themselves, and rested from the busy, bustling occupations of
the day;&mdash;and at the same time were spectators of the most splendid
scene imaginable. When the sun had gone down beneath a clear horizon,
and the moon had risen in silent majesty, dispensing her light over the
unruffled face of the Hudson, decorated with a numerous sail,
representing an inimitable landscape, sublime and beautiful.</p>

<a class = "pagenum" name = "page162" id = "page162"
href = "#par_page162">162</a>
<p>Alida walked out one evening, and repaired thither, attended by Mr.
More. It was six o’clock when they reached the Battery, and a numerous
concourse of people had already collected there. The mild rays of the
setting sun were just visible above the horizon, and cast a soft lustre
over the adjacent landscape, when they entered Castle-Garden to
contemplate more nearly the surrounding scenery.</p>

<p>They seated themselves here, while they discoursed on the beauties of
nature, and the wonders of creation,&mdash;descanting on the goodness
and bounty of that ineffable Being, from whom all our blessings
flow;&mdash;the continual succession of so many various objects, to fill
the mind with rapture and enthusiasm, and strike us with veneration and
awe.</p>

<p>The beauty and mildness of the present season, the copious showers,
that caused the earth to abound with teeming verdure; all of which drew
the contemplative genius insensibly to consider the benevolent purposes,
for which all these varieties are called forth in such abundance, to
excite the gratitude of man, and furnish a perpetual source of pleasure
and delight. “And can we,” said Alida, “who are conscious of deriving
our existence from a Being of such infinite
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page163" id = "page163"
href = "#par_page163">163</a>
goodness and power, properly entertain other prospects than those of
happiness, when we experience so many blessings daily, to excite our
thankfulness.”</p>

<p>Mr. More expatiated on the pleasure there must be in passing a
tranquil life with a beloved object, turning his <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘insiduous’">insidious</ins> eyes
towards Alida as he spoke; he seemed to say, that she was the being,
with whom he could be able to realize all the exalted ideas he
entertained of such a life; and to point out beauties, and furnish
amusement, to a refined taste like hers, would be to him one of the
highest pleasures he could possibly experience. When he declared to her
his esteem and affection, with his native sincerity, he seemed to be
convinced, at the same time, that she was favourably disposed towards
him.</p>

<p>On the contrary, she was evidently much embarrassed at this
declaration. She remained silent, and looked upon him with a degree of
pity mingled with regret; then casting down her eyes, she appeared
greatly confused. She could not make any returns in his favour, and the
amiable Alida felt extremely sorry to give pain or uneasiness to the
friend and school companion of an only brother. She had received him
with complacency on that account, which had served to increase his
ill-fated
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page164" id = "page164"
href = "#par_page164">164</a>
partiality. She felt that she could not give one word of encouragement,
yet she did not wish to drive him to despair.</p>

<p>The band of music now began to play in the garden. They commenced
with the celebrated air of the Star-Spangled Banner, and continued
playing different pieces for the space of several hours.</p>

<p>As soon as the music ceased, they left the garden to return home, and
all the people now apparently thronged out of the gates with as much
avidity as they had entered them some hours before. When they arrived at
the dwelling of Alida, they found that the time had whiled away, and
that the evening had progressed to a late hour.</p>

<p>On his way home the mind of Mr. More was absorbed in the following
reflections. “When I told her my affection, the blush was diffused over
her cheek&mdash;and the tear of sensibility started in her eye. She
evinced her regard by silent expressions, which she has shown repeatedly
in many proofs of interested friendship, accom&shy;panied by the
softness of her winning manners, and the engaging mildness of her
disposition. Bonville is her declared admirer&mdash;but he may not be a
favoured one. Should he meet with her approbation
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page165" id = "page165"

at any future time, would not his own fate be wretched, and the universe
would become a blank deprived of the society of Alida, shaded over with
the deepest tints of darkness and melancholy.”</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> scene was highly animated, and
the days were delightfully pleasant, when Alida returned with her
parents to the country. The showers of April had cleared the atmosphere
and revived <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘the the’">the</ins> earth with a lively gaiety. The ice in the bay and river
had melted away, and the steamboat had again began its course. The

stole its way through the forest, reflecting from its lucid bosom the
light cloud which dwelt in the air&mdash;floating on the gentlest
zephyrs. The hills and mountains teemed with verdure, and the serpentine
valleys were shaded by a friendly foliage. All nature flourished, grew,
and expanded, calling forth ejaculations of gratitude and piety, and
boldly declaring that a celestial Being overshadows us with his
providence.</p>

<p>As soon as the family were settled in the country, the parents of
Alida made preparation to call the children together in commemoration of
their father’s birthday. <!-- third time --> When the time arrived for
the
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page167" id = "page167"
href = "#par_page167">167</a>
celebration of this festive scene, the morning arose with every beauty
that could bid fair for a cheerful day, and the company assembled at an
early hour. Bonville was among those who arrived from the village. He
appeared in excellent spirits, as if some new thought had entered his
mind, which had given him new hopes of success. He informed Alida, in
the course of the afternoon, that he had received intimation from a
friend in England, that Theodore was now living in London. After
hazarding many conjectures respecting him, he then ventured to add that
he hoped he had not met there any new object, to cause him to become
forgetful of former friends. Displeasure was manifest in the countenance
of Alida, at this suspicion, although she feared it might be true.
Theodore had promised to be faithful in a correspondence, and he
certainly might have found opportunities, since the happy change of
affairs in the country, to make some communications to his friends, if
he had been so disposed. Again she thought, as they had been separated
by parental authority, that it might have its influence to cause him to
become altogether forgetful; and her spirits now sunk under the idea of
Theodore’s inconstancy. Bonville continued to speak of him with
indifference, observing attentively how Alida was affected. He inquired
earnestly if she had ever received any
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page168" id = "page168"
href = "#par_page168">168</a>
intelligence from him, during his absence, (as he thought he might have
written to her brother.) She answered him in the negative. He expressed
his surprise, and after giving many dark intimations of his perfidy, he
changed the subject.</p>

<p>Alida was before this extremely pensive and thoughtful, and these
injurious insinuations of Theodore, increased her dejection. She once
firmly believed she had a friend she could lean upon under all
circumstances, and his falsity appeared to her now confirmed.
A&nbsp;kind of gloomy superstition pervaded her mind, an anxious
foreboding of future evil, which all her pious reflections and reasoning
powers could not wholly control. She endeavoured to repress these
painful sensations, when in the presence of her parents; but the eyes of
her father frequently rested on her in filial anxiety. Her brother
likewise would often observe her innate sadness, and whatever his
thoughts might be as to the cause, he was still reserved, and forebore
to name any thing to his sister.</p>

<p>Although Bonville was sometimes conscious of his injustice towards
Theodore, and felt ashamed of his conduct, he was still determined to
proceed with reiterated calumnies, to the ear of Alida, with the hope to
ensure to himself her hand before Theodore would probably return to
America.</p>

L’ innocenza a e costretta a sofferire, talvolta le più crudeli

<p>The appearance of Bonville was imposing to look upon, his countenance
illumined by seeming sincerity and candour, no one could retain an idea
for any length of time, that was altogether detrimental. To a
treacherous heart, he joined a frankness of manner which amused and
interested every one in his favour. Though no one was ever more careless
of his veracity, yet he carried the appearance of authenticity in all he
said. He had never been used to restraint or disappointment, by the
silly indulgence of his parents, and seemed confident that he should
succeed in all his particular wishes, and thought that all obstacles
could be surmounted by his own machinations and management.</p>

<p>The evening was drawing near its close by a round of innocent
amusements, when a letter was handed Alida from her father, that he had
received from a friend in the city. It contained the unwelcome and
unexpected news of the death of Mr. Bolton, who arrived at Savannah at
an unfavourable season of the year, at a period when an epidemic fever
prevailed. He caught the infection, and a few days terminated the
existence of this amiable and accomplished youth. He was pious,
benevolent
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page170" id = "page170"

and charitable. He possessed a wisdom firm and unchangeable, strictly
adhering to the principles of the church and the Christian religion, and
was steadfast in his opinions against all opposition. He was deeply
regretted by a numerous acquaintance. His aunt mourned the loss of her
favourite nephew, and Alida’s father likewise deplored his premature
death, although he had thought proper to oppose his wishes.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> summer was past its meridian,
and had shed abroad its warmest influences, and enriched the various
scenes of nature with the luxuriance and beauty of its foliage. In the
meantime, Alida departed again from her father’s house for the city, to
join a party composed of gentlemen and matrons, Albert her brother, with
several young ladies, who all left the port of New-York for the Falls of
Niagara. Her pensive mind became cheered and animated as the gallant
steamer left the shores of the city and moved majestically over the
smooth face of the Hudson. The morning was extremely beautiful, and she
surveyed with a new and alleviating pleasure, the various and extensive
prospect of the surrounding country. The scenery on the river at this
season surpassed all description, and exhibited a landscape worthy to
relate in history. The borders of the river beautifully interspersed
with cottages, villages, and large flourishing towns, elegant
country-seats,
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page172" id = "page172"
href = "#par_page172">172</a>
with grounds tastefully laid out, which afforded to the eye of the
traveller a novel and enchanting appearance. They arrived about sunset
at the city of Albany, and took lodgings at Cruttenden’s boarding-house,
on an eminence near the Capitol or State-house.</p>

<p>This city, which is situated on the right bank of the Hudson, and
stands westward upon a rising ground, received its name, when in
possession of the English, in honour of James II., who was the duke of
York and Albany. On the following morning they took a walk through the
city. In consequence of its vicinity to the Ballston, Saratoga, and New
Lebanon Springs, in the fashionable season the hotel was so full of
strangers that no more could be accommodated.</p>

<p>Albany has received a new impulse, an increase of commerce, and
expects to reap the most happy results from the Erie canal, which
commences here, and runs a distance of three hundred and sixty-two miles
to Lake Erie. The company took a walk to the new basin, into which the
canal empties. It is separated from the Hudson by a dam which runs
parallel with the river.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 14th of August they took passage on board of
the Albany, one of the canal packet-boats, for Lake Erie. This canal,
which is three hundred and sixty-two miles in length, with
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page173" id = "page173"
href = "#par_page173">173</a>
eighty-three locks between the Hudson river and Lake Erie, which lies
six hundred and eighty-eight feet above the level of the former river.
The packet-boat took them from thence to Schenectady. It was covered,
and contained a spacious cabin. On account of the great number of the
locks, the progress of their journey was but slow. The boat was drawn by
three horses, that walked upon a narrow path leading along the canal,
and beneath the numerous bridges which are thrown over&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The distance from Albany to Schenectady by land is only fifteen
miles, and persons are enabled to travel it in a very short time in a
stage coach, but as they were anxious to see the canal, they preferred
going by water twenty-eight miles.</p>

<p>The city of Troy, five miles and a half above Albany, is pleasantly
situated on the left bank of the river, at the foot of several tolerably
high mountains, one of which is called Mount Ida. There is a branch
canal, which has two locks, and establishes a communication with Troy.
They soon arrived at a place where there were no less than nine locks,
with an ascent of seventy-eight feet. In front, and to the right of
this, is another canal, which unites with the Hudson and the canal from
Lake Champlain. At this place they left the Hudson, and directed their
course along the
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page174" id = "page174"
href = "#par_page174">174</a>
Mohawk river. During their ride, they observed a covered wooden bridge,
which extends over the latter river, a&nbsp;short distance from its
mouth, and is about six hundred feet in length, supported by fifteen
wooden piers. There was a fine view of the famous Cohoes Falls of the
Mohawk river, seventy-eight feet in height, and about four hundred feet
wide. In the spring, when these falls extend over the entire bed of the
Mohawk, they are said to be extremely magnificent. During this season of
dry weather, they presented a handsome appearance, though they were very
small, the river being almost completely dried up. Finding great
difficulty in continuing the canal on the right bank of the Mohawk, they
were obliged here to carry it to the opposite side of the river by means
of an aqueduct bridge one thousand one hundred and eighty-eight feet in
length. This bridge is supported by twenty-six stone columns, on which
account they have placed a chevaux-de-<ins class = "correction" title =
"text unchanged: source has ‘frise’">frieze</ins> to keep off the ice in
the river. The canal is cut through the rocks almost the whole distance,
where it runs along the left bank of the Mohawk, and presents a very
handsome appearance. Twelve miles further on, it returns again to the
right bank of the river, by a similar aqueduct, supported by sixteen
piers. Four miles farther on is Schenectady, where they arrived
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page175" id = "page175"
href = "#par_page175">175</a>
after sunset. Between this town and Albany they passed no less than
twenty-seven locks. At this place they left the packet-boat, and found
excellent lodgings at Given’s hotel, which, after the great heat they
had endured during the day, was exceedingly agreeable. Early on the next
morning they walked through the town, and visited Union College, which
consists of two large buildings situated at a short distance from the
town, upon a little eminence. From this building there is a beautiful
view of the town and of the Mohawk valley. They left Schenectady early
in the morning on board the packet-boat, which had engaged to take them
to Utica, eighty miles distant, by an early hour the next day. The canal
again ran along the well cultivated valley of the Mohawk, and the
prospect of the country, on account of the foliage of the trees upon the
heights, was beautiful.</p>

<p>The village of Amsterdam consists of a few neat houses. The canal is
carried over two rivers, called Schoharie, Canajoharie, from which it
receives the most of its water. At this place the horses were conveyed
to the opposite side of the two rivers by means of a ferry-boat. At the
first ferry is a small village, called Fort Hunter, where at the time of
the revolution there had been a fort, or rather a redoubt of the same
name. Towards
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page176" id = "page176"
href = "#par_page176">176</a>
evening they passed through a valley, which is formed by two rocky
mountains. There are twenty locks between Schenectady and Utica. The day
was intolerably warm, and the company very much oppressed by the heat,
but in the evening fortunately there was a thunder-shower, which cooled
the air. They passed over an aqueduct bridge during the night, which
stands over a solace called Little Falls. Towards morning they passed
through a well-cultivated region called German Flats, which was settled
by some Germans during the time of Queen Anne. At about ten o’clock they
arrived at Utica, which is intersected by the canal, and is a large,
flourishing town. In fact it is only here that a person begins to admire
the great improvements in cultivation, and gets perfectly new ideas of
the works of man and of his enterprising genius. Utica, on the right
bank of the Mohawk, has two banks and four churches. It has also several
taverns,<ins class = "correction" title = "missing ‘at’: see source">
&nbsp; </ins>the largest of which called Shepherd’s hotel, they found
excellent accommodations. There were besides many large and convenient
stores, a&nbsp;bookstore, and printing office. The number of travellers
this summer were unusually great, especially from the southern
states.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">At</span> Utica the gentlemen hired a stage
to visit the Falls of Trenton, distant fourteen miles. They were
accom&shy;panied in this route by a number of passengers from New-York
and North Carolina. They crossed the Mohawk upon a covered wooden
bridge. After this the road gradually ascended to a forest, which was in
part cleared for new fields. At a little distance from the falls is a
tavern, where they left the carriage, and went on foot through thick
woods, from which a pair of stairs conducted to the falls. The beautiful
mass of green around, the azure sky, the large and variegated rocks, and
the three falls, produce a most happy effect. The rocks of these falls
are so excavated by the water, that they have the form of a common
kettle. The upper falls, which are about ninety feet high, are the
grandest. They dined at the tavern, and towards evening returned to
Utica.</p>

<p>The day was fine and pleasant. They regretted that it was too late,
upon their return thither, to visit
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page178" id = "page178"
href = "#par_page178">178</a>
a hydrostatic lock designed to weigh the boats which pass on the canal.
Having seen enough of the canal, and being anxious to see the
newly-settled country between this place and Niagara, they continued
their journey the next day in the stage coach. With this intention they
left Utica at four o’clock in the morning, and the same day arrived at
Auburn, distant seventy-three miles. They passed through twelve villages
on their route from Utica to Auburn. Between Manchester and Vernon day
dawned, and they found themselves in a rather wild country, in the midst
of a wilderness. Behind the village of Oneida, the road led along a
considerable hill, from which they had a beautiful view of Oneida lake,
which presented the appearance of a large stream. Here there were a
number of extensive prospects, which, however, as there was but little
cultivated land and few houses, were rather uniform. Something further
on, after they had left Oneida, they came to a small lake, called Salt
Lake, which is in the midst of a forest, and has on its banks three
picturesquely situated towns, Liverpool, Salina, and Syracuse. At Salina
are rich salt springs, the water of which is collected in reservoirs,
and it is evaporated by the heat of the sun to procure the salt. Beyond
Sullivan they passed through the village of Chitteningo. A&nbsp;branch
of the Erie canal
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page179" id = "page179"
href = "#par_page179">179</a>
forms a kind of harbour at this place. They dined at Manlius, a&nbsp;new
village. From the canal, which forms an angle here, they drove in a
southerly direction in order to keep on the plains. The two Onondago
villages are pleasant places.</p>

<p>Beyond Marcellus the night unfortunately closed in, which prevented
their seeing Skaneateles Lake, as well as the town of the same name.
About nine o’clock in the evening they arrived at Auburn, and found good
accommodations at one of the public houses.</p>

<p>At four o’clock next morning they again set out in the stage coach
for Rochester, distant sixty-nine miles. It was just day-light when they
arrived in the vicinity of Cayuga, on the lake of the same name. This
lake empties into the Seneca river, which afterwards unites with the
Mohawk. They crossed the lake, not far from its mouth, on a wooden
bridge one mile in length. On the opposite side of the lake is a large
toll-house. At a short distance from this they arrived at Seneca Falls,
so called in consequence of the little falls of the Seneca river, which
are close by, and are chiefly formed by a mill-dam. Beyond Waterloo the
road in some places was made of logs, so that the passengers were very
disagreeably jolted. Geneva is situated at the north point of Seneca
Lake. The town
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page180" id = "page180"
href = "#par_page180">180</a>
derives its name from its similarity of situation to Geneva in
Switzerland. The Franklin hotel, situated on the bank of the lake, is
both spacious and beautiful.</p>

<p>Canandaigua, which lies on the north point of the lake of the same
name, is an extremely pleasant town. The court was sitting here, and
there was a large collection of people, so that the town exhibited a
very lively appearance. At this place the road separates, the left goes
through Batavia and several small villages to Buffalo on Lake Erie; the
right to Rochester, and thence to Lake Ontario and the Falls of Niagara.
And as this road again approaches the Erie canal, it was said to be the
most interesting; on this account it was given the preference, though
the longest route. They left Canandaigua in the afternoon, and rode
through Victor, Mendon, and Pittsford, to Rochester. They arrived at
Rochester at half-past eight o’clock in the evening, and took lodgings
at the Eagle tavern. They crossed the Genessee river, which divides
Rochester into two parts, on a wooden bridge built firmly and properly,
and the next morning walked through the town. Several hundred yards
below the bridge the Genessee river is about two hundred yards wide, and
has a fall of ninety-five feet. Above the falls is a race which conducts
the water to several mills,
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page181" id = "page181"
href = "#par_page181">181</a>
and it again flows up into the river below the falls, where it forms
three beautiful cascades.</p>

<p>Rochester is one of the most flourishing towns in the state of
New-York. At this place the Erie canal is carried over the Genessee
river by a stone aqueduct bridge. This aqueduct, which is about one
hundred yards above the Genessee Falls, rests upon a slate rock, and is
seven hundred and eighty feet long.</p>

<p>The party now left Rochester at nine o’clock, and went on board the
canal packet-boat Ohio. The canal, between Lockport and Rochester, runs
the distance of sixty-three miles through a tolerably level country, and
north of the Rochester ridge. This ridge consists of a series of rocks,
which form the chain of mountains which commences north of Lake Erie,
stretches eastward to the Niagara river, confines it, and forms its
falls; then continues its course, and forms the different falls which
are north of Lake Ontario, and is at length lost in the neighbourhood of
the Hudson. The canal runs a distance through sombre forests, when they
reached Lockport on the 20th of August, about seven o’clock in the
morning. At this place the canal is carried over the ridge by five large
locks, through which the water is raised to the height of seventy-six
feet. The locks are ten in number, being arranged in two
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page182" id = "page182"
href = "#par_page182">182</a>
parallel rows, so that while the boats ascend in one row, they may
descend at the same time in the other.</p>

<p>Lockport is an extremely pleasant place, and is situated just above
the locks. At Lockport they took a dearborn for Buffalo, where they were
anxious to go, in order to see the union of the canal with Lake Erie.
Though a good stage runs between Lockport and the Falls of Niagara, they
went in this bad vehicle five miles to the navigable part of the canal.
They then took passage in a boat at Cottensburgh. At this place also,
the canal is cut through a rock to the depth of about thirty feet. About
two or three miles farther on it terminates in the Tonawanta creek,
which serves as a canal for twelve miles. The creek is about fifty yards
wide, and runs through a dense and beautiful forest. At the new town of
Tonawanta, the creek unites with the Niagara river, where the sluice
leads off. At this place also Alida and her company had the first view
of the Niagara river, which conveys the waters of Lake Erie into Lake
Ontario, from the other extremity of which flows the St. Lawrence. In
this river they observed Grand Island. During the late war, the Niagara,
it is well known, formed the boundary line between the United States and
the British provinces in Upper Canada, and this island bore testimony of
the conflict.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">From</span> Tonawanta to Buffalo is eight
miles, five of which they travelled on the canal which runs along the
bank of the Niagara river as far as Black Rock.</p>

<p>Buffalo was burnt during the late war by the British, but it appeared
to be already rising from its ashes with increased beauty.</p>

<p>This town will soon become an important place, in consequence of its
situation near the mouth of the canal, and its harbour. At the entrance
of the harbour is a light-house, and on the lake were seen a number of
well-built vessels. A&nbsp;steam-boat called the Superior was ready to
run with fifty passengers to Erie, and thence to Detroit. There was an
amusing military spectacle. It consisted of a military parade,
consisting of thirty men, including seven officers and two cornets. They
were formed like a <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘battallion’">battalion</ins> into six divisions and performed a number
of manoeuvres.</p>

<p>On the following day, 21st August, the company
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page184" id = "page184"
href = "#par_page184">184</a>
left Buffalo for the small village of Manchester, twenty-three miles
distant, and situated on the right bank of the Niagara, near the falls.
As far as the village of Tonawanta, the road passes along the canal. It
was in a very bad condition, cut through the forest, and the trees
thrown on the road side. On the left they had a view of the river and
Grand Island. The river is more than a mile wide below the island. On
the Canada side is the village of Chippewa. From this place,
a&nbsp;distance of three miles, they could already see the rising
vapours of the falls. The water, however, indicated no signs of the
approach to the precipice. It is only a short distance from Manchester,
where you perceive the lofty trees on Goat Island, with its heights
situated in the midst of the falls, that the river becomes rocky, and
the rapids commence; these form a number of small falls, which are
nearly a mile long and the same in breadth, running as far as where the
two great falls are separated by Goat Island.</p>

<p>At Manchester they took lodgings at the Eagle Tavern, and hastened
immediately to the Falls; their steps were guided by the mighty roaring.
In a few minutes Alida and her company stood near the precipice, and saw
before them the immense mass of water which rushes with a tremendous
noise into the frightful abyss below. It is impossible
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page185" id = "page185"
href = "#par_page185">185</a>
to describe the scene, and the pen is too feeble to delineate the
simultaneous feelings of our insignificance on the one hand, with those
of grandeur and sublimity on the other, which agitate the human breast
at the sight of this stupendous work of nature, which rivals that of all
other countries, in grandeur, beauty and magnificence. We can only gaze,
admire and adore. The rocks on both sides are perpendicular, but there
is a wooden staircase which leads to the bed of the river. They
descended, but in consequence of the drizzly rain which is produced by
the foam of the water, they had by no means so fine a prospect from
below as they anticipated. On this account, therefore, they soon again
ascended and satisfied themselves by looking from above upon this
sublime and majestic sight. As they returned, full of these mighty
impressions, to the Eagle Tavern, they found to their great joy a fine
opportunity to speak of the grandeur and magnificence they had just
beheld. There was another party just arrived from New-York, to render
homage to this great natural curiosity.</p>

<p>In company with these gentlemen and ladies, they took a walk to
Goat-Island, by a convenient wooden bridge, thrown over the rapids about
seven years since. The first bridge leads to a small island called
Bath-Island, which contains a bath-house;
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page186" id = "page186"
href = "#par_page186">186</a>
the second to Goat-Island, which is about one mile in circumference, and
overgrown with old and beautiful trees.</p>

<p>On Bath-Island a person may approach so near the American falls as to
look into the abyss below. From the foot of the falls you can see
nothing of the abyss, inasmuch as every thing is concealed by the smoke
and vapour. On Goat-Island a person may in the same manner approach the
Canadian falls in the centre of which is a semi-circular hollow, called
the Horse-shoe, and here the noise is still more tremendous than on the
other side. The vapour which rises from the Horse-shoe, forms a thick
mist, which may be seen at a great distance. To look into the Horse-shoe
is awful and horrible. Nor can this be done but at the instant when the
vapour is somewhat dissipated. You stand like a petrified being. The
level of Lake Erie is said to be five hundred and sixty-four feet above
that of the sea, and three hundred and thirty-four feet above the waters
of Lake Ontario. Lake Ontario is consequently two hundred and thirty
feet above the level of the sea. From Lake Erie to the rapids the water
has a fall of fifteen feet, in the rapids fifty-seven feet, and
according to a recent measurement, the falls on the American side are
one-hundred and sixty-two feet high. From this place to
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page187" id = "page187"
href = "#par_page187">187</a>
Lewistown the river has a fall of one hundred and four feet, and thence
to Lake Ontario, of two feet.</p>

<p>The next morning they made another visit to Goat Island. They
afterwards descended the stairs to the river, which they crossed in a
small boat, at a short distance from both falls. The bed of the river is
said to be here two hundred and forty-six feet deep. The current passes
beneath the surface of the water, and does not again become visible till
after a distance of three miles. On the Canada side you have a much
better view of the falls than on the American, for you see both falls at
the same time. There is on the Canada side a covered wooden staircase,
which they ascended, and approached the falls, amidst a constant
drizzling caused by the falling water. The sun threw his rays upon the
thick mist and formed a beautiful rainbow. Another winding stair-case
leads down the rocks near the falls, under which you may walk to the
distance of one hundred and twenty feet; several of the gentlemen went
in, but according to their report, they could not see any thing. They
were contented, therefore, to behold the falls from Table rock, which
almost overhangs them. A&nbsp;part of this rock gave way several years
ago and fell down the precipice, and the remaining part is so much
undermined by the water, that it will probably soon follow. The whole
distance
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page188" id = "page188"
href = "#par_page188">188</a>
from the American to the British shore is fourteen hundred yards, of
which three hundred and eighty belong to the American falls, three
hundred and thirty to Goat-Island, and seven hundred to the Canada or
Horse-shoe falls. On the British side, opposite to the falls, are two
taverns, in the larger of which, Forsyth’s Hotel, they took lodgings
until the next day. During the late war a bridge was thrown over the
river about one mile above this tavern, which, together with a mill, was
burnt by the Americans on their retreat from the battle of Lundy’s Lane.
A&nbsp;few years ago a burning spring was discovered here. It is
surrounded by a cask, and contains cold water of a blackish appearance,
and of a sulphurous taste. Within this cask is a small vessel which has
a pipe at the upper end. If a lighted candle be held within a foot of
the mouth of this pipe, it will instantly produce a strong flame,
similar to a gas-light. In the neighbourhood of Forsyth’s Hotel is the
only point from which you have a full view of both falls at the same
time, which, however, is often interrupted by the ascending vapour.</p>

<p>On their return to the American shore, they examined a camera
obscura, which is situated at the head of the American stair-case, and
was built by a Swiss. This gives a tolerably good view of the
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page189" id = "page189"
href = "#par_page189">189</a>
falls. Afterwards they took a ride to the Whirlpool, which is three
miles down the Niagara, and is formed by a kind of rocky basin where the
river runs between narrow rocky banks. It is singular to see this
confusion of water, whose appearance cannot be better described than by
comparing it with the flowing of melted lead. The lofty rocks which form
the banks of the river, are beautifully covered with wood, and present a
stately, majestic appearance. In the evening they again went to
Goat-Island in order to view the falls by bright moonlight; in this
light they produce a peculiarly beautiful effect, which is greatly
heightened by a moon-rainbow.</p>

<p>The following day both parties went to the other side of the river,
and took lodgings at Forsyth’s Hotel.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> season was now far advanced.
Alida and her brother felt uneasy at being so long separated from their
father. The rest of the party were anxious again to see their friends in
the city. After tarrying a few days at Forsyth’s Hotel, they determined
to proceed on their way back again to New-York without delay.</p>

<p>They therefore concluded to travel soon, and visit Lake Champlain to
its southern extremity, then to Saratoga, Albany, taking the Catskill
mountains by the way, and inspecting the famous military school of West
Point.</p>

<p>The greatest breadth of Lake Champlain, which contains several large
islands, is six miles. The shore on the right, belonging to the state of
New-York, is low and covered with trees; the other belongs to Vermont,
and is more mountainous. As night approached, they were prevented from
beholding this beautiful part of the country; and were also, with
regret, prevented from seeing the battle-ground
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page193" id = "page193"
href = "#par_page193">193</a>
of Plattsburgh, at which town the vessel made a short stay during the
night, and then proceeded to Burlington, in Vermont, and towards morning
passed by the ruins of Fort Crown Point, which lie on a hill.</p>

<p>At this place the Lake is very narrow, and resembles a river. The
shores are generally covered with bushes and pine trees, are hilly, and
afford a pleasing prospect. They now pursued their journey as far as
Lake George, and arrived at the village of Caldwell. The shores of the
Lake are very hilly, the heights are all covered with trees, and are not
above eight hundred feet high. There are several islands in the lake,
generally covered with wood, and the scenery around is very handsome.
The level of the lake is about three hundred feet higher than that of
Lake Champlain. The stream which flows from the former into the latter
lake, forms, in its course, a&nbsp;succession of small cascades.</p>

<p>They left Caldwell at eight o’clock the next day, in two inconvenient
carriages, and passed through a very uninteresting, deep, sandy road, in
a hilly part of the country, covered with thorny trees, on their route
to Saratoga Springs, to which the whole fashionable world of the United
States repair in summer, and the fashionables have here the same
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page194" id = "page194"
href = "#par_page194">194</a>
mania which prevails in other countries, to visit the baths in summer,
whether sick or well. The distance is twenty-seven miles. On their
passage was seen but one interesting object, the Hudson falls, which
river they had left at Albany, and reached again nine miles from
Caldwell, coming from the west.</p>

<p>These falls are, however, under the name of Glenn’s Falls.
A&nbsp;village of the same name is built in their vicinity, on the rocky
shores of the river. The principal fall is forty feet high. These falls
are not to be numbered among the largest, but among the handsomest in
the United States. A&nbsp;constant mist arises from them, and, as the
sun shone very brilliantly, several rainbows were seen at the same time.
In the rock, as at Niagara, were some remarkable and deep cavities. At
the base of the small island which divides the chief fall into two
parts, a&nbsp;remarkable cave appears below the falls, leading to the
other side of the rock. The Hudson is partly navigable above Glenn’s
Falls, and two miles farther up, feeds a navigable canal, with thirteen
locks, which runs seven miles north of the Hudson, and there joins
Champlain canal.</p>

<p>The party arrived at Saratoga at two o’clock in the afternoon, and
stopped at Congress Hall. The greater part of the company had already
departed,
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page195" id = "page195"
href = "#par_page195">195</a>
among those who remained was the governor of the state of New-York. They
were introduced to his Excellency. The gentlemen conversed with him
freely, and found him intelligible and refined, and scientific in his
conversation.</p>

<p>In the evening the company assemble in the large hall in the lower
story, and pass away the time in music, dancing or conversation, where
they witness all the politeness, refinement, and hospitality that
characterize the Americans.</p>

<p>The waters of the different springs are generally drank, but baths
are also erected. High Rock spring flows from a white conical lime-stone
rock, five feet high. The water is seen in this spring in constant
agitation. So much fixed air escapes from it, that an animal held over
it, as in the Grotto del Cane, near Naples, cannot live above half a
minute.</p>

<p>In a few days they left Saratoga Springs, in a convenient stage, to
go to Albany, thirty-six miles distant. They passed through a
disagreeable and sandy country. The uniformity was, however, very
pleasingly interrupted by Saratoga Lake, which is eight miles long.</p>

<p>At the small town of Waterford they passed along the left shore of
the Hudson on a long wooden bridge, to avoid a bad bridge over the
Mohawk. They proceeded on their route in the night on a
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page196" id = "page196"
href = "#par_page196">196</a>
very good road, and passed through Lansingburgh and Troy. The latter is
very handsomely built, and many stores were very well lighted up in the
evening. Here they returned to the right shore of the Hudson, and
reached Albany at ten o’clock at night.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock next morning they took passage on board the
steam-boat, to go down the river as far as the town of Catskill, at the
foot of Pine Orchard. The company ascended the mountain, which is twelve
miles high, in stages. They reached Pine Orchard a little before sunset.
The building on the mountain for the accommodation of visiters, is a
splendid establishment. Alida was truly delighted with the landscape it
presented in miniature; where large farms appeared like garden spots,
and the Hudson a rivulet, and where sometimes the clouds were seen
floating beneath the eye of the spectator.</p>

<p>The next morning they again took the steam-boat at Catskill to go to
Hudson, twenty-seven and a half miles from Albany, which they reached
about noon. This city appears very handsome and lively. On the opposite
side of the river is Athens, between which and Hudson there seems to be
much communication kept up by a team-boat. A&nbsp;very low island in the
middle of the stream between the two places, rendered this communication
somewhat difficult
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page197" id = "page197"
href = "#par_page197">197</a>
at first, as vessels were obliged to make a great circuit. To avoid this
inconvenience, a&nbsp;canal was cut through the island, through which
the team-boat now passes with ease and rapidity.</p>

<p>This place affords a very fine view of the lofty Catskill mountains.
They left the city of Hudson in the afternoon, and arrived at West Point
at eleven o’clock at night, on the right side of the Hudson, and landed
at a wharf furnished with a sentry-box. An artillerist stood sentinel.
They were obliged to ascend a somewhat steep road in order to reach the
house which is prepared for the reception of strangers. The building
belongs to the government, and is designed for the mess-room of the
officers and cadets. The purveyor for this table is bound by contract
with the government to keep several chambers with beds in order for the
reception of the relations of the cadets.</p>

<p>The morning after their arrival, the gentlemen paid an early visit to
lieutenant-colonel Thayer, superintendent of the military school, and
were received in a very friendly manner. He had presided over this
school several years. Colonel Thayer has entirely remodelled this
institution, and very much improved&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The cadets, whose number may amount to two hundred and fifty, are
divided into four classes for
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page198" id = "page198"
href = "#par_page198">198</a>
the purposes of instruction. They are received between the ages of
fourteen and twenty, and must undergo an examination before they
enter.</p>

<p>Instruction is communicated gratuitously to the cadets, each of whom
receives monthly eight dollars from government as wages.</p>

<p>A public examination of the cadets takes place every year at the end
of June, by a commission appointed by the Secretary of War. This
commission consists of staff officers from the army and navy, members of
Congress, governors of states, learned men and other distinguished
citizens. After this examination, the best among those who have finished
their course are appointed as officers in the army.</p>

<p>The cadets live in two large massive buildings, three stories high,
and are divided into four companies. The institution possesses four
principal buildings. The two largest serve as barracks for the cadets,
a&nbsp;third contains the mess-room, and the fourth the church.
A&nbsp;large level space, consisting of several acres, lies in front of
the buildings, forming a peninsula, and commanding the navigation of the
Hudson, above which it is elevated one hundred and eighty-eight feet.
Towards the river it is surrounded by steep rocks, so that it is
difficult to ascend, unless by the usual way.</p>

<a class = "pagenum" name = "page199" id = "page199"
href = "#par_page199">199</a>
<p>The party now ascended the rocky mountain on which are to be seen the
ruins of Fort Putnam. The way led through a handsome forest of oak,
beech, chestnut and walnut trees. The fort occupying the summit of the
mountain, was erected in an indented form, of strong granite, and is
altogether inaccessible on the side next the enemy. It had but a single
entrance, with very strong casemates. It was built on private property
during the revolution; the owner of the ground claimed it, and
government were obliged to restore it. The government afterwards
acquired the ground on which West Point stands, as well as the adjoining
heights.</p>

<p>A very fine view one may have from Fort Putnam of the plains of West
Point and of the Hudson river. The view to the north is particularly
handsome, in which direction Newburgh, lying on the river, is seen in
the back ground.</p>

<p>A band of music, paid by the government, belongs exclusively to the
cadets, and is said to afford the best military music in the United
States.</p>

<p>The party generally regretted leaving this agreeable place, where
they had been highly gratified during their short stay. They took
passage on board the steamboat Constitution, bound to New-York, sixty
miles distant.</p>

<p>They were now again on their way to one of the
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page200" id = "page200"
href = "#par_page200">200</a>
most flourishing cities in the United States, which attracts a great
part of the commerce of the American nation. They came into the vicinity
about sunset, and at eight o’clock in the evening they landed in
New-York. Leaving their friends in the city, Albert and his sister took
passage in a stage coach next morning, and journeyed in a short time as
far as the village of &mdash;&mdash;, and from thence proceeded on to
the residence of their father.</p>

Ah! now again all my sensations move to see a parent, and I sigh once
more to meet the kind caresses of a father&mdash;and weeks seem ages in
this separation.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> feelings of Alida were those of
boundless joy to meet again her parents, after an absence from them
which appeared long to her.</p>

<p>She was grieved to find her father had suffered much from
indisposition during her absence. She endeavoured in vain, by every
soothing attention, to recall him again to health and happiness. His
malady increased daily, and he became a prey to infirmities, which at
length confined him to his room.</p>

<p>The gladsome sensations of Albert were changed soon to those of
melancholy, when he saw that his father was affected with a serious
illness, and dejection supplied the place of more happy and animated
feelings.</p>

<p>Alida, for several weeks, scarce left the apartment. One morning she
perceived that he had altered very materially for the worse. It was only
at intervals he could converse with her, and then his conversation was
calculated to give her fortitude and resignation, and prepare her mind
for an
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page202" id = "page202"
href = "#par_page202">202</a>
approaching melancholy event, which, whenever she received the least
hint of, her grief was inexpressible.</p>

<p>Her father observed her emotion. “Alida, my dear child,” said he, “do
not be alarmed, as I appear much worse than I am in reality at present;”
but she had drawn these words from the physician that morning, that his
malady had increased greatly since the day before. Perceiving a visible
change in his appearance, she scarcely left the room of her father till
a late hour, when he, perceiving her almost fainting with fatigue,
requested her to retire to rest. Albert supplied the place of his
sister, and remained with his father, while the affectionate care of his
only surviving son was grateful to the bosom of a fond parent.</p>

<p>The slumbers of Alida were broken, and fearing to leave her father
too long, she arose very early next morning to attend him. He was
evidently much worse next day, which was Sunday, and intimated that he
wished all the family sent for. He then requested Alida to read some
passages in the bible, as was his daily custom.</p>

<p>“‘Leave thy fatherless children to me and I will be their father,’
what words of consolation are these,” said he, “what transport do they
convey to the heart of a parent, burthened with anxiety. Yes, divine
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page203" id = "page203"
href = "#par_page203">203</a>
Disposer,” he exclaimed, “I&nbsp;will, with grateful joy, commit my
children to thy kind care and protection.”</p>

<p>When the physician made his morning visit, as he was going to take
leave, Alida asked his opinion. He shook his head, and seemed to give no
hopes of recovery.</p>

<p>Her father requested her to be seated by the bedside. “My child,”
said he, “I&nbsp;wish to discourse a little with you. And could I again
see Theodore, how gladly would I now receive him. I&nbsp;have deeply
injured him,” said he, “and my child too; and have inflicted a wound
still deeper in my own bosom. I&nbsp;have often considered his piety and
worth. His moral character was all that it should be. Superfluous wealth
is not necessary to ensure earthly felicity, but a competency and
contentment therewith, is all that is necessary to happiness.”</p>

<p>“Do not renew your sorrows, dear father,” said Alida, “what is past
is beyond recall. Let us confide in a just over-ruling Providence, that
disposes all material events for the wisest purposes.” Her tears flowed
in abundance, as her looks rested upon the visage of her father, and
deep distress was depicted in her countenance.</p>

<p>“My dear child,” said her father, “weep not for me, think that rest
must now be acceptable to the weary traveller, whose hopes are centred
in the
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page204" id = "page204"
href = "#par_page204">204</a>
Redeemer, (as the only name under Heaven, whereby we can be saved,) and
can leave the world in the joyful anticipation of receiving those
inestimable blessings, in a life to come, which the Gospel promises to
every true believer.”</p>

<p>He had scarcely uttered these words, when he sunk almost senseless
upon his pillow. The greater part of the family now assembled round him.
The physician came and gave no hopes of recovery. He faithfully watched
over him the whole evening and a part of the night, and about twelve
o’clock his family had the sorrow and misfortune to witness the
distressful and trying scene. Their father was no more.</p>

<p>The distress, fatigue and agitation of Alida, could no longer be
borne with, and for many weeks she was confined to her room. The loss of
her parent and the terminating scene, had left her in deep affliction:
all repose seemed fled forever, and bitter anguish had succeeded, and
taken up its residence in her bosom. Reflections rose in her mind
continually, that her situation had been heretofore comparatively happy,
to what it at present afforded. An illness of short duration had
suddenly deprived her of a very dear father, and she now felt herself a
lonely, dejected orphan.</p>

Could I trace back the time, a distant date, since my ancestors
traversed these fields, and held possession of this wide domain.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> melancholy event had taken
place, and Albert had lost his father. His heavy and heartfelt
affliction could not at this time be alleviated, and his mind was
involved in gloom and sadness, which he endeavoured in vain to
dissipate.</p>

<p>He was now deprived of the kind hand of a parent, who had used his
endeavours to lead him in the way he should go, from his infancy: and
assisted him with a kindly advice, and supplied him with a timely
experience, and in the wisdom of whose salutary council, he could now no
longer repose.</p>

<p>He felt himself deprived of this kind assistant, whose precepts had
been his guide ever since the first dawning irradiations of reason had
began to appear, to enlighten his mind, and with the eye of vigilance
watched over him, endeavouring to trace out his good or evil
propensities, and to point to the particular advantages on the one hand,
and the baneful effects on the other, and to train his ideas to whatever
was most commendable, and praiseworthy.</p>

<p>Albert had ever evinced a disposition pleasing to
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page206" id = "page206"
href = "#par_page206">206</a>
parental hopes and wishes, and flattering to a fond father’s most
sanguine anticipations. He was ever cheerful in complying with whatever
he considered his duty, and conformable to the will of his interested
parent.</p>

<p>He now revolved in his mind, and reflected what had heretofore been
his particular wishes. It had long been the wish of his parent, that he
should close his business in New-York, and settle himself on the
paternal estate. He, therefore, was diligent in his endeavours to do
this, as soon as his spirits would in any wise allow him to attend to
these affairs, and at the commencement of the ensuing spring, he happily
terminated his business in the city, and returned to the country.</p>

<p>The remembrance of his father for a long interval of time was in
every object around and about the mansion, in which he was established,
and reminded him of his bereavement, and he was affected with sorrowful
meditations, and a borrowed serenity was manifested in his
appearance.</p>

<p>He reflected on his present condition,&mdash;he would say, how
desultory is the happiness of man, he lays plans of permanent felicity,
when the whirlwind of affliction arrives, and destroys the towering
edifice of creative hope, and his schemes of contentment are changed to
disappointment and&nbsp;wo.</p>

<a class = "pagenum" name = "page207" id = "page207"
href = "#par_page207">207</a>
<p>He had taken possession of the paternal estate, which had for some
years been the wish of his father. Like him he was fond of rural
pleasures and amusements, and to dissipate care amid the diversified
scenes of rustic life, afforded him satisfaction and pleasure.</p>

<p>To contemplate the inimitable works of Creation, was to him no less
pleasing than instructive. Where so many objects arrest the attention,
and afford abundance of entertainment, equally calculated to raise in
the human breast the most unfeigned offerings of wonder, gratitude and
praise to the great Dispenser of benefits to mankind, and the Author of
universal existence.</p>

<p>The magnificence of the celestial, and the curiosity and variety of
the vegetable world, that have properties which, if accurately seen,
yield inconceivable astonishment to the eye of the beholder, and confess
alike the happy influence of the Deity. It charms in all the genial
warmth and softness of spring, when the earth teems with a matchless
splendour, when its green hues and universal verdure come forth in all
their pristine elegance and enchanting attractions, which constantly
afforded the contemplative mind of Albert, an inexhaustible variety of
entertaining and useful lessons.</p>

<p>In the meantime his new station in life called him
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page208" id = "page208"
href = "#par_page208">208</a>
to new responsibilities, and a new field of action, unknown to him
before, presented itself, wherein he must act in many different
capacities. He was naturally of a domestic turn of mind, and had always
declined entering into the constant routine of engagements, to which the
most part of the fashionable world, more or less, subject themselves. He
avoided all excess and extravagance, in every respect, in which people
of this description lose the greater part of their time. He was
extremely fond of walking, as he considered gentle exercise the best
medicine of life, and he passed much of his time in strolling over the
fields or in the forest glen, amid the green wood shade, wrapped up in
solitary reflection.</p>

<p>When the sun was <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘gliding’: see parallel version">gilding</ins> the western hemisphere,
and the day shone in all the mildness of the season, enveloped in
serious thought and reverie, Albert walked forth among the surrounding
shades. “Happy, ye freeborn sons of Columbia,” said he, “liberty and
plenty now bless your domestic retirements,&mdash;War, devastation and
wide-wasting rapine have fled your peaceful shores. No dread of
destruction to disturb your uninterrupted tranquil&shy;lity; the
exercise of laudable industry can again bring home to each family
competency and repose.” The clear cerulean sky added a soft beauty to
the adjacent
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page209" id = "page209"
href = "#par_page209">209</a>
landscapes, as he listlessly wandered along the beach. The idle
murmuring of the waves upon the sandy shore, the confused gabbling of
the waterfowl, and the near view of the full-spread vessel majestically
advancing over the white-capped billows, that advanced and receded in
gentle monotony, tended to soothe the lone bosom to calmness and
quietude.</p>

<p>The day ended, and calm evening drew on. The silver rays of the
full-orbed moon shed a majesty on each surrounding object. The scene
appeared in solemn grandeur; the dusky forest reflected a yellow
radiance; and the rolling wonders of the heavens glittered over the
head, while awful stillness reigned, interrupted only by the strains of
the night-bird, whose melodious notes served to soothe the heart to
harmony.</p>

<p>Albert returned home with a leisurely step, his feelings were raised
in devotional gratitude to that beneficent Being, on whom we depend for
every present and future felicity, and who had surrounded us with so
many blessings, that conspire to compose the mind to calmness and
serenity.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">Alida</span> ruminated on her lonely
situation. She reflected on former days, and the many happy hours that
had gone by for ever, when the roses of health had arrayed her cheeks,
and gay thought had filled her fancy, and every object was decked with
the charms of fascination, when her heart was unacquainted with sorrow,
and experienced serenity and happiness without alloy. She deplored the
loss of a kind father; in him she was deprived of a friend, who could
never be again supplied to her, and in whose society her mind was in a
constant progressive state of improvement. His filial affection, his
kindness, his watchful endeavours for her welfare, were evinced by a
careful anxiety and pains to enlighten her mind with those qualities and
acquirements, that would be most conducive to enlarge her sphere of
usefulness in life, and furnish her with the means of rational pleasure,
and to blend with her personal appearance the more fascinating charms of
a well-improved understanding.</p>

<a class = "pagenum" name = "page211" id = "page211"
href = "#par_page211">211</a>
<p>She mourned his loss at a residence where every object recalled him
continually to her remembrance. She was wholly absorbed in melancholy,
and amid these sad ideas that agitated her bosom alternately, Bonville
arrived from the neighbouring village, and her attention was for a time
diverted, and she was relieved from a train of painful reflections. Her
brother had a long conversation with him respecting Theodore, and
wondered how it happened that his friend Raymond had never received any
intelligence from him.</p>

<p>Bonville seemed much embarrassed at these observations of Albert, and
it was some length of time before he made any reply. Then biting his
lips, and putting on an air of displeasure, he said that he had actually
thought of going to England himself, to trace him out, and ascertain the
cause of his strange conduct. Then assuming a look of insignificance,
accom&shy;panied with several speeches in double entendre, he remained
in sullen silence.</p>

<p>The conduct of Theodore certainly, thought Alida, is mysterious and
singular, and his long silence is truly unaccountable, and the idea of
ever meeting him again with these different impressions, that at present
bore sway over her mind, agitated her greatly. In happier days, when her
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page212" id = "page212"
href = "#par_page212">212</a>
hopes had rested on him in full confidence, she thought herself
sufficiently strong to bear every other evil; but to be assured of his
inconstancy, was an idea she could scarcely endure.</p>

<p>Although Albert might decidedly be called a person of discernment,
still he had not yet fully discovered the deceptive powers of Bonville,
whose many evil propensities were in a manner concealed, by a
condescending courtesy and affability; though his mind inherited
ill-nature and sarcasm in the extreme.</p>

<p>The sprightliness of his manners, mingled with a certain degree of
humour and generous sentiments, occasionally mingling with his
discourse, threw a veil over his imperfections, and excited one’s
admiration.</p>

<p>Albert thought him ungenerous for many scandalous assertions
concerning Theodore, and he still hoped he might again arrive on his
native shores, and be able to answer all suggestions to his
disadvantage.</p>

<p>Alida had never discerned his real character, therefore she reposed
full confidence in all he said. His behaviour to her was respectful, and
his exterior extremely prepossessing. He appeared all goodness and
benevolence, and ever expressed the
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page213" id = "page213"
href = "#par_page213">213</a>
most generous sentiments towards those he pretended to censure.</p>

<p>These deceitful appearances were joined with a semblance of piety;
and he could at any time make himself appear to advantage, by the
display of a variety of superficial knowledge. He was proud to excess,
as if he really possessed qualities to be proud of. One would scarcely
suppose that such a person could be capable of true attachment, but so
it certainly was; that knowing the many imperfections of his own nature,
caused him more deeply to revere the opposite qualities in Alida, and
the idea of shortly gaining her hand, carried his senses to such a pitch
of enthusiasm, that it would not be thought strange to suppose, that the
disappointment of his pride would overwhelm him with lasting dismay.</p>

<p>The superior excellence of Theodore furnished a mark for the calumny
of Bonville, supposing his own success depended on the disparagement of
the other. Thus envy is usually led to asperse what it cannot imitate;
and the little mind scandalizes the pre-eminence of its neighbour, and
endeavours to depreciate the good qualities that it cannot
attain&nbsp;to.</p>

<p>Thus the distempered eye is impatient of prevailing brightness, and
by attempting to observe
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page214" id = "page214"
href = "#par_page214">214</a>
the lucid object, inadvertently betrays its own weakness; and persons of
their unhappy complexion, regard all praises conferred upon another, as
derogatory from their own value. And a person without merit may live
without envy; but who would wish to escape it on these terms!</p>

</div>


<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> scenes of solitude were now more
pleasing to Alida than ever. She loved to wander through the shady grove
and lonely valley, and adapt their retirement to her own particular
situation. She would often stray as far as the cottage or the farmhouse,
at a little distance, and would sometimes take the winding path through
a beautiful piece of wood which led to Raymond’s, where the thick
foliage formed a grateful shade.</p>

<p>There she would indulge herself in solitary thought. “How changeable
are all things terrestrial,” said she, “the varied year has its seasons,
and winter and summer are constantly in pursuit of each other. The
elements are frequently disturbed by storms and tempests, so, in like
manner, is the human breast at intervals troubled and discomposed, and
often remains overshadowed with pensive sadness and cheerless reverie;
and these desponding ideas must continue to have influence over the
mind, till the sunshine of reason
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page216" id = "page216"
href = "#par_page216">216</a>
and religion kindly dispels the gloom, and awakens anew the feelings of
the heart to the rays of hope and more enlivening sensations.” She had
just returned home one afternoon from Raymond’s, when her brother, who
had been absent on business to the city, drove up the avenue,
accom&shy;panied by Mr. More.</p>

<p>Albert informed his sister of the arrival of Theodore. She almost
fainted at the intelligence, so unexpected: and although she wished of
all things, to learn all the circumstances attending his absence, yet
she dreaded the event, to behold him again, fearing the truth of
Bonville’s suggestions.</p>

<p>In the midst of these thoughts and fears, Theodore alighted at the
house, and was shown by the servant into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Theodore, regardless of all around him, as soon as he beheld Alida,
he grasped her hand, exclaiming with rapture, “Has the period at length
arrived, and am I indeed once more so happy as to meet again my
much-esteemed and long-lost friend.”</p>

<p>Alida gazed on him in silence. He saw her extreme agitation, and
after they were seated, he observed more particularly her altered
appearance. What surprise and grief was manifest in his countenance,
when he saw the paleness of her cheek, and the roses that once spread
their healthy hue
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page217" id = "page217"
href = "#par_page217">217</a>
over them, now seemed fled for ever. In a length of time, she became
somewhat more composed; but in what light to consider Theodore, she yet
did not know, and former ideas still clouded her imagination.</p>

<p>At length she assumed sufficient courage, to ask him, why he had not
thought proper to inform any of his friends of the circumstances
attending his absence.</p>

<p>Theodore could scarcely remain silent while Alida was speaking; he
was surprised beyond all description at what he heard. “Can it be
possible,” said he, “that you have missed of information concerning me,
when I delayed not to inform you of all my movements, every opportunity
I had to convey intelligence.” He then informed her that the letters had
been sent to Raymond, and those for herself were enclosed, and committed
to his care; and through this channel, he had related minutely all the
various trials and circumstances attending his unexpected journey, and
the cause of his protracted stay. Alida was evidently convinced, and
appeared again assured of the truth of her lover. The energy with which
he spoke, his agitated feelings, joined to the distress visible in his
countenance, convinced her of his sincerity, at least caused her to
doubt, what a few moments before appeared so
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page218" id = "page218"
href = "#par_page218">218</a>
incontestible: and her present happiness fully compensated for the
lengthy period of distress and anxiety she had experienced.</p>

<p>Albert was delighted at the return of Theodore, and highly gratified
in his hopes, to find in his early friend, still the man of honour he
had ever considered him. He had never once mentioned his name to Alida
during their separation; although his thoughts often revolved on the
unhappy result of their acquaintance, and the future welfare of his
sister.</p>

<p>Mr. More was a silent spectator of this joyful meeting. He now beheld
the person who had been so happy as to win the esteem and affections of
Alida, a&nbsp;person that he had heard spoken of, though it had appeared
that he never expected to see.</p>

<p>He witnessed the happy meeting. Sighs and tears from this time were
his only companions, while his aspect pourtrayed nought but anguish and
utter despair. He looked upon this happy pair as already united. He shed
tears of evident anguish, when he took leave of Alida, and his looks
told her it must now be forever.</p>

<p>The evening was not far advanced, when Bonville, who was altogether
ignorant of Theodore’s arrival, unexpectedly made his appearance. Struck
with the utmost consternation at seeing him, he involuntarily
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page219" id = "page219"
href = "#par_page219">219</a>
receded a few paces, then suddenly advancing, as if recollecting
himself, he gave him his hand with seeming cordiality.</p>

<p>The natural politeness and civility of the other supplied the place
of a more cordial reception.</p>

<p>Ten thousand fears at once agitated the bosom of Bonville, while he
appeared half frantic with grief and apprehension. Dismay threw a sudden
cloud over his understanding; he was confused in the extreme. He had
intercepted all the letters of Theodore; he secretly reproached himself
for his treacherous conduct.</p>

<p>He now saw the termination of all his hopes. Disappointment he could
not brook, his pride could never submit to it with any degree of
resignation, and the bitterness that pervaded his mind, almost bordered
on phrenzy.</p>

<p>His conscience reproved him for reiterated misrepresentations and
calumnies of Theodore, with which he had harrassed the mind of Alida. He
knew that a discovery must now be made of his perfidy, and on his return
home to the village, he was confined to his room with a sudden illness,
succeeded by a dangerous fever.</p>

vicinity, or resorted in the summer season to the neighbouring
village.</p>

<p>Albert had descended from an ancient family, he had an estate to
preserve, but not an entailed one, as was the case with many of his
family, at this time in England.</p>

<p>He was a gentleman, placid, humane and generous; altogether
unacquainted with that ambition which sacrifices every thing to the
desire of fortune, and the superfluous splendour that follows in her
train. He was unacquainted with love too, the supreme power of which
absorbs and concentrates all our faculties upon one sole object. That
age of innocent pleasure, and of confident credulity, when
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page221" id = "page221"
href = "#par_page221">221</a>
the heart is yet a novice and follows the impulse of youthful
sensibility, and bestows itself unreservedly upon the object of
disinterested affection; then, surely, friendship is not a name. Albert,
during his abode in the city, had associated with ladies of rank, beauty
and accom&shy;plishments. He was a general favourite among them; he had
been flattered, courted and caressed, but none had the power to fix his
attention. Since his return to the country, he had been frequently
invited to assemble among the artless villagers, decorated in their own
native beauty, assisted sometimes for ornament with the spoils of Flora.
Health, pleasure and <ins class = "correction" title = "spelling unchanged">naivette</ins>, was in the air of these charmers, and all
that was pleasing to win his regard and esteem. These scenes of rural
pleasure, these social parties, were adapted to his taste. In comparison
of which the gay assemblages of the city had been formerly
uninteresting; and he had been heard to say, that whenever his mind
should become fixed, his choice would be some lady who resided in the
country.</p>

<p>Although Albert experienced a degree of happiness and contentment
unknown to many, in his present situation, yet he sometimes felt himself
very lonely.</p>

<p>Alida was anxious that her brother should look out for a suitable
companion; if he could be fortunate
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page222" id = "page222"
href = "#par_page222">222</a>
enough to find one that was amiable and sensible, and whose actions
should be under the influence of genuine piety; one who would be
ambitious to preserve domestic sunshine, by the goodness and equanimity
of her disposition; who would have a tear for distress, a&nbsp;heart for
friendship and love, exerted in benevolence and charity, and in the mean
time have a care to the good order and arrangement of domestic duties
and economy.</p>

<p>Albert often descanted in conversation with his friends, on the
general neglect of female education, which consisted of a few trifling
embellishments, while those of the more substantial order were left out
of the question. He thought that young ladies generally were not
sufficiently learned in the solid branches, to exercise their mental
powers to advantage, or to be agreeable, intelligent companions.</p>

<p>“If it be true,” said he, “that our pleasures are chiefly of a
comparative or reflected kind, how supreme must be theirs, who
continually reflect on each other the portraitures of happiness, whose
amusements</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Though varied still, are still the same</p>
<p>In infinite progression.”</p>
</div>

<p>“How tranquil must be the state of that bosom, which has, as it were,
a&nbsp;door perpetually open to the
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page223" id = "page223"
href = "#par_page223">223</a>
reception of joy or departure of pain, by uninterrupted confidence in,
and sympathy with, the object of its affection<ins class = "correction"
title = "quotation marks unchanged">!” “</ins>I&nbsp;know of no part of
the single life,” said Albert, “more irksome than the privation we feel
by it, of any friendly breast wherein to pour our delights, or from
whence to extract an antidote for whatever may chance to
distress&nbsp;us.”</p>

<p>“The mind of a good man is rather communicative than torpid. If so,
how often may a person of even the best principles, expose himself to
very disagreeable sensations, from sentiments inadvertently dropped, or
a confidence improperly reposed. What but silence can be recommended,
since, in breaking it, so much danger is incurred among those who are
little interested in our welfare? A&nbsp;good heart, it is true, need
not fear the exposition of its amiable contents. But, is it always a
security for us, that we mean well, when our expressions are liable to
be misconstrued by such as appear to <ins class = "correction" title =
"text unchanged">lay</ins> in wait only to pervert them to some
ungenerous purpose?”</p>

<p>“The charms, then, of social life, and the sweets of domestic
conversation, are pre-eminent. What more agreeable than the converse of
an intelligent, amiable, interesting friend; and who more intelligent
than a well educated female? What more engaging than gentleness and
sensibility itself? Or
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page224" id = "page224"
href = "#par_page224">224</a>
what friend more interesting, than one we have selected from the whole
world, as a companion in every vicissitude of life?”</p>

<p>“If either party be versed in music, what a tide of innocent pleasure
must it prove, to be able to soothe in adversity, to humanize in
prosperity, to compose in jargon, and to command serenity in every
situation? How charming a relaxation from the necessary avocations of
business on the one hand, and the employments at home, in domestic
affairs, on the other! And as a finale, to chant the praises of the
Almighty in hymns of praise and thanksgiving.”</p>

<p>Albert had lately made several visits at some distance from home,
where he had told his sister, were several young ladies, who were very
agreeable. Alida did not think this of any importance, as she knew her
brother heretofore had been difficult to please. She was one day rather
surprised, when he wished her to accom&shy;pany him thither. She
declined the invitation, however, not thinking he wished it for any
particular reason.</p>

<p>In the course of a few days he pressed her again to go with him.
Alida now thought she would accom&shy;pany him, if it was only out of
curiosity. When they arrived at the house of Albert’s new acquaintance,
several ladies were introduced one after the
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page225" id = "page225"
href = "#par_page225">225</a>
other, and Alida soon found, that one of them had arrested the attention
of her brother particularly. She, however, thought him rather premature,
as he had so recently become acquainted with the family. On their return
home, he gave her to understand, that his affections were engaged, and
in the course of a few months, she was called on to attend their
nuptials.</p>

<p>The appearance of Eliza was interesting; she was tall and graceful.
Her large dark hazel eyes sparkled beneath a beautiful arched eyebrow,
and her transparent complexion was shaded and adorned by profuse locks
of dark brown hair.</p>

<p>In the meantime Albert appeared perfectly happy, that he had at
length found a fair one to please him, and shortly after he returned
home with his bride, with sanguine expectations before him, anticipating
much future happiness.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> disagreeable facts so long in
detail, had now taken a new turn for the better, and Theodore and Alida
were again in possession of more than former felicity, after their long
separation. Alida soon began to recover in some degree her native
cheerfulness, soothing the bosom of her lover with her grief-dispersing
smile. The unpleasant fears that had such a length of time harrassed her
mind, were now happily terminated by the return of Theodore and the
clearing up of all doubts and suspicions concerning him, to the utter
confusion of Bonville. All her corroding anxieties were now removed, and
recent events had made her happy in comparison to what she was a few
weeks before, and her present consolation fully compensated for all the
preceding months of unhappiness.</p>

<p>Theodore was again happy in the society of Alida, the pensive
sweetness of her manner, her innate goodness, and amiability, which had
attracted and secured the early affections of his heart, and made
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page227" id = "page227"
href = "#par_page227">227</a>
impressions that could never be obliterated. He gave a minute account of
all that had happened, from the time they had parted until they had met
again.</p>

<p>He had visited the merchants in England with whom his father had been
concerned in business, and he found as he expected, that he had been
overreached by swindlers and sharpers. The pretended failure of the
merchants with whom he was in company, was all a sham, as, also, the
reported loss of the ships in their employ. The merchants had fled to
England; he had them arrested, and they had given up their effects to
much more than the amount of their debts. He therefore procured a
reversion of his father’s losses, with costs, damages and interests,
when legally stated.</p>

<p>Theodore then made his next visit to Raymond’s. His friends were
joyfully surprised at his arrival. He stayed the night and related a
long narrative to his friend. Early next day he proceeded from thence to
his father’s house, where he arrived after a considerable journey.
Theodore found his parents more happy than he expected. With abundant
joy they welcomed him whom they had given up for lost.</p>

<p>Theodore then related to his father all the incidents that had
happened in England, minutely
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page228" id = "page228"
href = "#par_page228">228</a>
particularizing his conduct with regard to the merchants with whom his
father had been connected, and then presented him with the reversion of
the estate.</p>

<p>The old gentleman fell on his knees, and with tears streaming down
his cheeks, offered devout thanks to the great Dispenser of all
mercies.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the illness of Bonville had increased to an alarming
degree. He sent for Theodore. He thought it his duty to attend the
summons. When he arrived at the house of Bonville he was shown
immediately into his apartment. He was surprised to see him stretched on
a mattrass, his visage pale and emaciated, his countenance haggard, his
eyes inexpressive and glaring. He held out his hand and feebly beckoned
to Theodore, who immediately approached the bed-side.</p>

<p>“You behold me, Theodore,” said he, “on the verge of eternity.
I&nbsp;have but a short time to continue in this world.” He evidently
appeared to have suffered much from the remembrance of his ungenerous
conduct towards Theodore.</p>

<p>“I have caused much unhappiness between you and your Alida,” said
Bonville, “to which you will scarcely think it possible that I was
designedly accessory.” He then confessed to Theodore that he had
intercepted his letters, and begged his forgiveness.
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page229" id = "page229"
href = "#par_page229">229</a>
“I could say much more on the subject would my strength admit,” said he,
“but it is needless.” Here Bonville ceased. Theodore found he wanted
rest; medical aid had been applied, but without effect. Theodore then
left him, promising to call again next morning.</p>

<p>He was startled at the confession of Bonville; he felt at first
indignant, and meditated what course to pursue. After due reflection, he
at length made the decision.</p>

<p>His devotions to Alida he did not wonder at. The pride of parental
attachment and nature had graced her with every charm and
accom&shy;plishment. He at length determined to cast a veil of pity over
the actions of Bonville, and not to upbraid him, but to treat his past
conduct with silent contempt, and endeavour as far as possible, to bury
the remembrance of his errors in oblivion. He called to see him next
morning; he perceived an alarming alteration in his appearance. He was
cold&mdash;a&nbsp;chilling sweat stood upon his face, his respiration
was short and interrupted, his pulse weak and intermitting. He took the
hand of Theodore and feebly pressed it. He soon fell into a stupor;
sensation became suspended. Sometimes a partial revival would take
place, when he would fall into incoherent muttering, calling on the
names of his deceased father,
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page230" id = "page230"
href = "#par_page230">230</a>
mother, and Alida. Towards night he lay silent, and only continued to
breathe with difficulty, when a slight convulsion gave his freed spirit
to the unknown regions of existence. Theodore attended his funeral, and
then journeyed on to the dwelling of Albert. He informed Alida of the
death of Bonville, and of his confession.</p>

<p>At the mention of Bonville’s fate, she sighed deeply. “It is true,”
said she, “he has perplexed me with many vain fears, by
misrepresentation, but could he have lived, I&nbsp;would freely have
forgiven him.”</p>

<p>He evidently fell a victim to disappointed pride and remorse at the
remembrance of his own baseness.</p>

</div>


<p><span class = "firstword">Theodore</span>’s father was soon in
complete re-possession of his former property. The premises from which
he had been driven by his creditors, were yielded up without difficulty,
to which he immediately removed. He not only recovered the principal of
the fortune he had lost, but the damages, with the interest; so that,
although like Job, he had seen affliction, like him, his latter days
were better than the beginning. Like him, he reposed faith and
confidence in his Maker, who had secretly supported him in his
misfortunes; and who now, like a cheering sun dispersing the surrounding
gloom, again gladdened his heart with returning peace and prosperity.
Wearied of the business of life, he did not again enter into its
affairs, but placing his money at interest in safe hands, he lived
retired on his estate.</p>

<p>It was also the decided choice of Theodore and Alida to reside in the
country. The calm and serene pleasures of retirement were particularly
interesting
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page232" id = "page232"
href = "#par_page232">232</a>
to both, and they were now supremely blest in each other’s society.</p>

<p>The parents of Theodore rejoiced at their present happiness, and took
upon themselves the necessary preparations for their nuptials, which
were to take place as soon as all was in readiness for this happy
event.</p>

<p>No cross purposes stood ready to intervene, to disturb their repose
or interrupt their tranquil&shy;lity. It was at that season when nature
was arrayed in her richest ornaments, and adorned with her sweetest
fragrance. Silk-winged breezes played amidst the flowers, and birds of
every description carolled their song in varying strains. The air was
clear and salubrious, and the scene enchanting.</p>

<p>And now, reader of sensibility, indulge the pleasing sensations of
thy bosom, at the approaching union of Theodore and Alida. To our hero
and heroine, the rural charms of the country furnished a source of
pleasing variety. Spring, with its verdant fields and flowery
meads&mdash;summer, with its embowering shades&mdash;the fertility of
autumn, with its yellow foliage&mdash;winter, with its hollow blasts and
snowy mantle, all tended to fill their bosoms with sensations of
pleasing transition.</p>

<p>Their religious principles were the same. They were a constant
assistance to each other in the fulfilment
<a class = "pagenum" name = "page233" id = "page233"
href = "#par_page233">233</a>
of their pious duties, truly endeavouring to follow the life of the
Redeemer, who taught by his example and practice, what he required of
us. Assiduously cultivating those innate Christian principles and
perfections, best calculated to promote the praise and glory of God, and
whereby we may obtain the everlasting favour of that ineffable Disposer
of all things, in whom we live, and move, and have our being.</p>

<p>But soon a mournful shade was thrown over their peaceful
tranquil&shy;lity and happy anticipations; and manifest was their grief,
when they received the dreadful intelligence that Mr. More had committed
suicide. At the news of this rash and sinful action, they were thrown
into an abyss of sorrow, the painful remembrance of which, for a long
time, threw a dark and melancholy cloud over their felicity.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that a spirit of religion and philosophy had
not been more duly exercised in the mind of Mr. More, that at length by
patience and resignation, he might have been brought to see how vain and
transitory are all these things; and thereby have been led to look for
permanent happiness to a nobler source.</p>

Notes on <i>Alida</i></a></h4>

<p class = "center">
<a href = "#author">The Author</a><br>
<a href = "#chron">Chronology</a><br>
<a href = "#sources">Sources</a><br>
<a href = "#parallel">Parallel text</a></p>

<p>The following is a little more personal than the average
Transcriber’s Note. Given the nature of the book, this may be
inescapable.</p>

<p>In classical literature, there is a form called the <i>cento</i>. The
word does not mean a hundred of anything; it comes from the Greek word
for patchwork. In its original form, the cento takes small pieces of
familiar works such as the Aeneid and reassembles the
segments&mdash;anywhere from a few words to two full lines&mdash;into a
new text. As rearranged, the content can be anything from saints’ lives
to outright obscenity.</p>

<p>With rare exceptions, <i>Alida</i> cannot be called a cento. While
some borrowings involve single phrases, most range from to paragraphs to
entire chapters. I&nbsp;(the transcriber) first stumbled across the book
while searching for the originals of some quoted passages in <i>Alonzo
and Melissa</i>. This novel turns out to have been one of <i>Alida</i>’s
favorite sources, contributing a solid six-chapter block as well as many
shorter segments. Appropriately, <i>Alonzo and Melissa</i> was itself
pirated; its credited author did not actually write the book.
Conversely, a&nbsp;number of other sources were formally
copyrighted&mdash;sometimes in the same office where the copyright of
<i>Alida</i> was filed.</p>

<p>Only about half the sources (by rough word count) have been
identified. Isolated phrases&mdash;three or four significant
words&mdash;were disregarded unless they were very unusual, or from a
source quoted many other times. Unidentified sources include:</p>

<div class = "hanging">

<p>&mdash; most of the longer poetry</p>

<p>&mdash; discussions of education (female and general)</p>

<p>&mdash; religious material, probably from a then-new denomination
such as Baptist or Methodist</p>

<p>&mdash; most references to the secondary character Mr. More
(apparently from a single source, possibly a subplot in some other
book)</p>
</div>

<p>If you come across a long passage that you recognize, e-mail lucy2424

<h5><a name = "author" id = "author">Alida: The Author</a></h5>

<p>One of the few things definitely known about Amelia Stratton
Comfield, the author of <i>Alida</i>, is what she looked like in 1852,
when her portrait was painted by David Rogers:</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/portrait.jpg" width = "447" height = "548"
alt = "portrait of author"></p>

<p>This picture has been altered to align horizontals and verticals and
to highlight the two copies of <i>Alida</i> (on bookcase behind subject,
and in her hand); this accounts for the jagged edges. At time of
preparation (mid-2010), the original was online at <a href =
"http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!348307!0">the
Smithsonian collection</a>.</p>

<!-- <p>Published family histories offer an Amelia Stratton from Long
Island who married an Englishman named John Comfield&mdash;but this
Amelia was born in the early 1780’s, and the subject of the portrait is
manifestly not seventy years old.</p> -->

<p>Amelia Stratton Comfield was probably related to Southern writer and
educator Catherine Stratton Ladd (1808&ndash;1899), who wrote under a
number of pseudonyms&mdash;including “Alida”.</p>


<h5><a name = "chron" id = "chron">Alida: Chronology</a></h5>

<p>The chronology is internally consistent: that is, the passage of time
based on descriptions of seasons agrees with datable external events,
even in the part of the story that draws heavily on <i>Alonzo and
Melissa</i>. The war of 1812 began in mid-1812 and ended in December
1814; evidently the news reached New York before it reached New
Orleans.</p>

picked simply because it was the most readily available; it may or may
not have been the edition used by the author. All [<i>sic</i>] notations
were added by the transcriber; all brackets in <i>Alonzo and Melissa</i>
are in the original.</p>

<p>Sources that are used only once are identified as they occur in the

<div class = "allclear">

<h6>Non-Fiction</h6>

<p>Karl Bernhard, Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach: <i>Travels through North
America, during the years 1825 and 1826</i>. Translation published 1828.
<span class = "abbrev">“Travels”</span></p>

<p class = "inset">
Chapters XXIV-XXVII inclusive, except the poetry, are taken from this
book. See beginning of <a href = "#par_chapXXIV">chapter XXIV</a> for
more information.</p>

<p class = "space">
John Warner Barber: <i>Interesting Events in the History of the United
States ...</i> (exact title varies). First edition 1827; later editions
include 1828 and 1834, with reprints of each. Details of wording point
to the 1828 edition as the source.</p>

<p class = "inset">
The segments dealing with the war of 1812 are quoted extensively:
“Second War with Great Britain”; the battles of Queenstown, Lake Erie,
Niagara and Lake Champlain; Death of Tecumseh; the Hartford Convention;
“Piracies in the West Indies”.</p>

<p class = "space">
Nathaniel Dwight: <i>Sketches of the lives of the Signers of the
Declaration of Independence</i>. First Edition 1830; quotations from
1840 edition (reprint of 1830).
<span class = "abbrev">“Lives of Signers”</span></p>

<p class = "inset">
Used primarily for character descriptions. Most are applied to male
characters in the novel, but one passage is inserted into a description
of Dolly Madison. With one exception, all selections are taken from
representatives of Northern states.</p>

<p class = "space">
Mrs. James Madison. Here quoted from <i>The American Magazine of Useful
and Entertaining Knowledge</i>; the article was printed in other
publications.</p>

<p class = "inset">
Some parts of this article refer to the period when James Madison was
Secretary of State under Jefferson.</p>

<p class = "inset">
Much of the article quotes from the chapter on Dolly Madison in a longer
work: American Academy of the Fine Arts (James Herring and James Barton
Longacre), <i>The National Portrait Gallery of Distinguished
Americans</i> (no later than 1834).</p>

<p class = "space">
<i>A sketch of the life and public services of William H. Harrison,
commander in chief of the North-western army during the War of 1812,
&amp;c.</i> Many editions from 1835 and later.</p>

<p class = "space">
Charles Phillips: Speech at Dinas Island on George Washington. Widely
reprinted; the version published in the author’s <i>Collected
Speeches</i> is different from earlier published versions quoted
here.</p>

<p class = "space">
Lindley Murray: <i>The Power of Religion on the Mind</i>. First edition
1836; many later editions and reprints. Quotations from 1863 (the only
edition available to me).</p>

<p class = "inset">
Not a religious work but a collection of short biographies with
character description. Except for the article on Job, attributions are
too short to be certain; <i>Alida</i> may have found similar phrases in
a different source.</p>

<p class = "space">
Francis Smith Eastman: <i>A history of the state of New York ...</i>
First edition 1828; later edition (with reprints) 1831. Details of
wording identify the 1831 edition (or a later one) as the source.</p>

<h6>Fiction</h6>

<p>Daniel Jackson/Isaac Mitchell: <i>Alonzo and Melissa</i>. For
details, see Project Gutenberg <a href =
"http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/28112">e-text 28112</a>. Written 1804 by
Mitchell; first book publication (pirated by Jackson) 1811, with many
reprints. Wording in <i>Alida</i> does not consistently correspond to
any of the editions used for the <i>Alonzo and Melissa</i> e-text.
Quotations are generally from 1811 except where a different edition
matches the wording more closely.
<span class = "abbrev">“A&amp;M”</span></p>

<p class = "inset">
By word count, <i>Alida</i>’s favorite source: chapters VII-XII
inclusive, much of the adjoining chapters VI and XIII, most of
XXXIII-XXXIV (the final two chapters), and many other passages of
varying length. See beginning of <a href = "#par_chapVI">chapter VI</a>
for more information.</p>

<p class = "space">
Regina Maria Roche: <i>The Children of the Abbey</i>. First published
1796, reprinted throughout the following century. Quotations from
1877.</p>

<p class = "space">
Mrs. (Mary Martha) Sherwood: <i>The Broken Hyacinth</i>; <i>The Lady of
the Manor</i>.</p>

<p class = "inset">
<i>Alida</i> may contain other quotations from this author; most phrases
are too short to be unambiguous. Mrs. Sherwood’s fiction has a strong
religious element, and she seems the kind of author Amelia Comfield
would have liked.</p>

<p class = "space">
Robert Folkestone Williams: <i>Mephistophiles in England, or the
Confessions of a Prime Minister</i>. 1835.</p>

<p class = "inset">
<i>Alida</i> only quotes one passage from this two-volume novel. The
episode may have been reprinted in some other text, or the novel itself
may have lifted it from an earlier source.</p>

<p class = "space">
Amelia Stratton Comfield: <i>Alida</i>.</p>

<p class = "inset">
When all else fails, the book quotes itself. One passage appears three
times.</p>

<h6>Periodicals and Short Fiction</h6>

<p><i>The New-York Weekly Magazine, Or, Miscellaneous Repository</i>:
Volume II, 1797. Reprinted as a single bound volume containing 52 8-page
issues (July 1796-June 1797).
<span class = "abbrev">“NY Weekly”</span></p>

<p class = "inset">
Only two volumes of this periodical, and a few issues of the third, were
published; only volume II was available to me. At least 30 separate
pieces are quoted in <i>Alida</i>, so it is likely that some
unidentified sources are in volumes I or III.</p>

<p class = "inset">
Most essays were printed with minimal attribution, or none at all; some
can also be found in other sources. “The Nettle and the Rose” also
appears in <i>The Blossoms of Morality</i> (1796) and in <i>New-York
Magazine</i>, N.S. II (1797). “On Education” is taken from the writings
of Vicesimus Knox; “Detraction” is by Nathaniel Cotton.</p>

<p class = "space">
“Amelia, or the Faithless Briton”. Here quoted from <i>The New-York
Magazine, or, Literary Repository</i>: Vol. VI (1795); the story also
appears in <i>The Lady’s Weekly Miscellany</i> (1810).</p>

<p class = "space">
“The Merchant’s Daughter”. Here quoted from <i>The American Monthly
Magazine</i>, Vol. 3, 1834.</p>

<p class = "space">
“The Story of an Unfortunate Young Lady”. Here quoted from <i>The Lady’s
Miscellany, or, Weekly visitor...</i> Vols. 14&ndash;15 (1811)</p>

<h6>Poetry</h6>

<p>Most poems are quoted only once, and will be identified as they
appear. The author of <i>Alida</i> was obviously fond of poetry,
especially obscure poems found in periodicals or privately published
books.</p>

<p class = "space">
James Thomson (d. 1748): <i>The Seasons</i>. The work was reprinted many
times. Quotations are from the 1829 Hartford edition.</p>

<p class = "inset">
There exists an 1842 edition of <i>The Seasons</i> which also contains
Bloomfield’s <i>Farmer’s Boy</i> (see chapter XIV). If similar
collections were published earlier, this might be the source for both
poems.</p>

<p class = "inset">
In <i>Alida</i>, passages from <i>The Seasons</i> are almost always in
quotation marks.</p>

<p class = "space">
Mary (Mrs. Henry) Tighe: <i>Psyche, with Other Poems</i>. Quoted from
1816 London edition.</p>

<p class = "inset">
Quoted works: <i>Verses Written at the Commencement of Spring</i>
(1802); <i>Verses Written in Sickness</i> (1804); <i>A&nbsp;Faithful
Friend is the Medicine of Life</i>.</p>

<p class = "missing">The season was now far advanced in autumn, and the
trees were nearly stripped of their foliage; the radiant sun had in part
withdrawn his enlivening rays to give place to the approaching coldness
of winter, when Alida left her home, amid the innumerable regrets of her
juvenile companions, to accom&shy;pany her father to the city to finish
her education.</p>

<p class = "missing">They journeyed in a stage-coach from the village of
&mdash;&mdash;, which, in the course of a few hours, conveyed them amid
the tumultuous din of the busy metropolis. The female seminary to which
Alida repaired was pleasantly situated in the western part of the town,
where the refreshing and salubrious
<a class = "pagenum" name = "par_page29" id = "par_page29"
href = "#page29">29</a>
breezes of the Hudson rendered it a healthy and desirable situation at
all seasons of the year.</p>

<p class = "missing">Although her father had only performed his duty in
placing his child once more at school, yet it was at a greater distance
from the paternal roof than formerly, and when he returned again to his
residence, he felt his situation more lonely than ever, and he could
scarcely reconcile himself to the loss of her society.</p>

<p class = "missing">All was novel-like in the city to Alida, where she
at once saw so many different objects to excite alternately her
surprise, curiosity, and risibility, and where she experienced so many
different sensations, arising from the sudden transition in being
removed from scenes of uninterrupted tranquil&shy;lity to those of
gaiety and pleasure, of crowded streets and riotous entertainments, of
obsequious beaux and dashing petits maîtres, and where all appeared to
her one continued scene of business and confusion, scarcely
reconcileable.</p>

<p class = "missing">In the meantime her mind became engrossed by
various new occupations. Among her favourite studies was the French
language, which, at this period, was considered as one of the necessary
appendages to female education, when scarcely any new work could be read
without a regret to those who did not understand it. Music, dancing, and
<a class = "pagenum" name = "par_page30" id = "par_page30"
href = "#page30">30</a>
drawing occupied her time alternately, and while these different
amusements afforded a pleasing variety, they animated her mind anew with
the powers of exertion that had been excited by early
impressions&mdash;that whatever she attempted to learn, to be assiduous
to learn it well, and that a mere superficial knowledge, in any science
or accom&shy;plishment, was by no means desirable.</p>

<p class = "missing">All her studies and amusements had their regular
arrangements, and due application gave her many advantages over those of
her own age, while it expanded her mind in a greater degree, and
facilitated her progress in learning, and gave more ready improvement to
her understanding and native capacities.</p>

<p class = "missing">Her only surviving brother, whose name was Albert,
had been a merchant in the city a number of years, and he still
continued to live amid its perplexities, (although numbers had been
unfortunate around him,) with as good success as could be expected at
this time, on account of the restrictions on American commerce. One
probable reason may be assigned why he had been more successful in his
business than many others: he was guided in the management of his
affairs by vigilance and industrious perseverance, and he was not only
endued with the best abilities to fulfil the duties
<a class = "pagenum" name = "par_page31" id = "par_page31"
href = "#page31">31</a>
incumbent on his station in life, but was not remiss in the exercise of
them. His manners, generally, were reserved, though he could be humorous
and gay whenever occasion required; and when in convivial society, he
could make one among the number of those who amused themselves in
sallies of wit and pleasantry. He had acquired much useful and general
information in his commerce with the world at large, which he employed
at this time in various conversations on politics, as he could not be
able to render himself serviceable to his country in any other way,
being exempt from his childhood from performing military duty. His
personal advantages were only surpassed by the superior qualifications
of his mind, that had long been under religious influence and
impressions.</p>

<p class = "missing">The father of Alida now thought proper to enter
into a second marriage. A&nbsp;lady of worth and understanding had
wrought upon his fancy, and won his particular regards. Her elegance of
manner and dignified deportment engaged general attention; and although
she was rather advanced in life, yet “the remains of former beauty were
still visible in her appearance.”</p>

<p class = "missing">She was honourably descended from English parents,
who had resided in New-York since the revolution. Her father had been
actively engaged in business there, which had been ultimately crowned
with the successful gifts of fortune.</p>

<p class = "missing">Her education had been governed by the strictness
of the English discipline. A&nbsp;foundation laid in early piety
continued to influence her mind with unaffected ardour, blended with a
generous benevolence, the genuine effects of the inexhaustible goodness
of her heart. She was one who manifested to the world that a “doer of
good” is far preferable
<a class = "pagenum" name = "par_page105" id = "par_page105"
href = "#page105">105</a>
to any other character, and in a superlative degree above those who
maintain high principles in theory, without ever once reducing them to
practice.</p>

<p class = "missing">This lady had an only sister, who married a native
of Ireland, and after the course of a few years went to reside there,
where she had recently died. The children returned to this country,
having lost their father long before, and several of her nephews now
resided in the city. Having been always accustomed to reside in town
herself, where her many excellent qualities had endeared her to numerous
friends and acquaintances, who would now feel themselves lost without
her society, therefore the parents of Alida formed the conclusion to
pass their winters in the city, and return to the country in the summer
season.</p>

<p class = "missing">In the mean time, Alida’s father thought the event
fortunate, and was pleased at this time to remove his daughter from the
place where the late scenes appeared so trying and afflictive, with the
hope that in mingling her with the gay world she would in a while forget
Theodore, while he in his turn would be induced to leave the
neighbourhood.</p>

selfish propensity, without once seriously reflecting on its

elevated station gave him caused him to neglect to practice those better
principles of which his nature might have been capable. His pride would
suffer to see Alida united to another, therefore he was determined not
to relinquish her. He concluded that finally she would look upon
Theodore with indifference, and become favourably disposed towards
himself; while his regard for her should prove unchange&shy;able. That,

that her father was much to blame in attempting to control her liberty
of choice; saying, moreover, that after their views should be
accomplished, that he had no doubt whatever of his reconciliation. He
had lately received intelligence of the death of an uncle in Savannah,
who had bequeathed to him his fortune. He was preparing for his
departure thence. He would not, therefore, give up his former project,

endeavour to forget her in any other light than as a friend. “Can you
suppose, Mr. Bolton,” said she, “that I would set a parent’s will at
defiance, by committing so unwary an action as to dispose of myself in a
clandestine manner, nor could you again imagine that I would give my
hand where my heart has no particular regard.” She scarcely uttered
this, and could say no more ere he conjured her not to shut her heart

A&nbsp;very low island in the middle of the stream between the two
places rendered this communi&shy;cation somewhat difficult at first, as
vessels were obliged to make a great circuit. To avoid this
incon&shy;venience, a&nbsp;canal was cut through the island, through
which the team-boat now passes with ease and rapidity.</p>
